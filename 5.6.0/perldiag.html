D &amp; S) can be controlled using the <code class="inline"><span class="w">warnings</span></code>
 pragma.</p>
<p>If a message can be controlled by the <code class="inline"><span class="w">warnings</span></code>
 pragma, its warning
category is included with the classification letter in the description
below.</p>
<p>Optional warnings are enabled by using the <code class="inline"><span class="w">warnings</span></code>
 pragma or the <strong>-w</strong>
and <strong>-W</strong> switches. Warnings may be captured by setting <code class="inline"><span class="i">$SIG</span>{<span class="w">__WARN__</span>}</code>

to a reference to a routine that will be called on each warning instead
of printing it.  See <a href="perlvar.html">perlvar</a>.</p>
<p>Default warnings are always enabled unless they are explicitly disabled
with the <code class="inline"><span class="w">warnings</span></code>
 pragma or the <strong>-X</strong> switch.</p>
<p>Trappable errors may be trapped using the eval operator.  See
<a class='function-name' href="functions/eval.html">eval</a>.  In almost all cases, warnings may be selectively
disabled or promoted to fatal errors using the <code class="inline"><span class="w">warnings</span></code>
 pragma.
See <a href="https://search.cpan.org/perldoc/warnings">warnings</a>.</p>
<p>Some of these messages are generic.  Spots that vary are denoted with a %s,
just as in a printf format.  Note that some messages start with a %s!
Since the messages are listed in alphabetical order, the symbols
<code class="inline"><span class="q">&quot;%(-?@</span></code>
 sort before the letters, while <code class="inline"><span class="s">[</span></code>
 and <code class="inline">\</code>
 sort after.</p>
<ul>
<li><a class='view-title' id="%22%25s%22-variable-%25s-masks-earlier-declaration-in-same-%25s"></a><strong>"%s" variable %s masks earlier declaration in same %s</strong>
<p>(W misc) A "my" or "our" variable has been redeclared in the current scope or statement,
effectively eliminating all access to the previous instance.  This is almost
always a typographical error.  Note that the earlier variable will still exist
until the end of the scope or until all closure referents to it are
destroyed.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="%22my-sub%22-not-yet-implemented"></a><strong>"my sub" not yet implemented</strong>
<p>(F) Lexically scoped subroutines are not yet implemented.  Don't try that
yet.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="%22my%22-variable-%25s-can't-be-in-a-package"></a><strong>"my" variable %s can't be in a package</strong>
<p>(F) Lexically scoped variables aren't in a package, so it doesn't make sense
to try to declare one with a package qualifier on the front.  Use local()
if you want to localize a package variable.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="%22no%22-not-allowed-in-expression"></a><strong>"no" not allowed in expression</strong>
<p>(F) The "no" keyword is recognized and executed at compile time, and returns
no useful value.  See <a href="perlmod.html">perlmod</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="%22our%22-variable-%25s-redeclared"></a><strong>"our" variable %s redeclared</strong>
<p>(W misc) You seem to have already declared the same global once before in the
current lexical scope.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="%22use%22-not-allowed-in-expression"></a><strong>"use" not allowed in expression</strong>
<p>(F) The "use" keyword is recognized and executed at compile time, and returns
no useful value.  See <a href="perlmod.html">perlmod</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="'!'-allowed-only-after-types-%25s"></a><strong>'!' allowed only after types %s</strong>
<p>(F) The '!' is allowed in pack() and unpack() only after certain types.
See <a class='function-name' href="functions/pack.html">pack</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="%2f-cannot-take-a-count"></a><strong>/ cannot take a count</strong>
<p>(F) You had an unpack template indicating a counted-length string,
but you have also specified an explicit size for the string.
See <a class='function-name' href="functions/pack.html">pack</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="%2f-must-be-followed-by-a%2c-A-or-Z"></a><strong>/ must be followed by a, A or Z</strong>
<p>(F) You had an unpack template indicating a counted-length string,
which must be followed by one of the letters a, A or Z
to indicate what sort of string is to be unpacked.
See <a class='function-name' href="functions/pack.html">pack</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="%2f-must-be-followed-by-a*%2c-A*-or-Z*"></a><strong>/ must be followed by a*, A* or Z*</strong>
<p>(F) You had a pack template indicating a counted-length string,
Currently the only things that can have their length counted are a*, A* or Z*.
See <a class='function-name' href="functions/pack.html">pack</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="%2f-must-follow-a-numeric-type"></a><strong>/ must follow a numeric type</strong>
<p>(F) You had an unpack template that contained a '#',
but this did not follow some numeric unpack specification.
See <a class='function-name' href="functions/pack.html">pack</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="%25-may-only-be-used-in-unpack"></a><strong>% may only be used in unpack</strong>
<p>(F) You can't pack a string by supplying a checksum, because the
checksumming process loses information, and you can't go the other
way.  See <a class='function-name' href="functions/unpack.html">unpack</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="%2f%25s%2f%3a-Unrecognized-escape-%5c%5c%25c-passed-through"></a><strong>/%s/: Unrecognized escape \\%c passed through</strong>
<p>(W regexp) You used a backslash-character combination which is not recognized
by Perl.  This combination appears in an interpolated variable or a 
<code class="inline"><span class="q">&#39;</span></code>
-delimited regular expression.  The character was understood literally.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="%2f%25s%2f%3a-Unrecognized-escape-%5c%5c%25c-in-character-class-passed-through"></a><strong>/%s/: Unrecognized escape \\%c in character class passed through</strong>
<p>(W regexp) You used a backslash-character combination which is not recognized
by Perl inside character classes.  The character was understood literally.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="%2f%25s%2f-should-probably-be-written-as-%22%25s%22"></a><strong>/%s/ should probably be written as "%s"</strong>
<p>(W syntax) You have used a pattern where Perl expected to find a string,
as in the first argument to <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/join.html">join</a></code>.  Perl will treat the true
or false result of matching the pattern against $_ as the string,
which is probably not what you had in mind.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="%25s-(...)-interpreted-as-function"></a><strong>%s (...) interpreted as function</strong>
<p>(W syntax) You've run afoul of the rule that says that any list operator followed
by parentheses turns into a function, with all the list operators arguments
found inside the parentheses.  See <a href="perlop.html#Terms-and-List-Operators-(Leftward)">Terms and List Operators (Leftward) in perlop</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="%25s()-called-too-early-to-check-prototype"></a><strong>%s() called too early to check prototype</strong>
<p>(W prototype) You've called a function that has a prototype before the parser saw a
definition or declaration for it, and Perl could not check that the call
conforms to the prototype.  You need to either add an early prototype
declaration for the subroutine in question, or move the subroutine
definition ahead of the call to get proper prototype checking.  Alternatively,
if you are certain that you're calling the function correctly, you may put
an ampersand before the name to avoid the warning.  See <a href="perlsub.html">perlsub</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="%25s-argument-is-not-a-HASH-or-ARRAY-element"></a><strong>%s argument is not a HASH or ARRAY element</strong>
<p>(F) The argument to exists() must be a hash or array element, such as:</p>
<pre class="verbatim"><ol><li>    <span class="i">$foo</span>{<span class="i">$bar</span>}</li><li>    <span class="i">$ref</span>-&gt;{<span class="q">&quot;susie&quot;</span>}[<span class="n">12</span>]</li></ol></pre></li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="%25s-argument-is-not-a-HASH-or-ARRAY-element-or-slice"></a><strong>%s argument is not a HASH or ARRAY element or slice</strong>
<p>(F) The argument to delete() must be either a hash or array element, such as:</p>
<pre class="verbatim"><ol><li>    <span class="i">$foo</span>{<span class="i">$bar</span>}</li><li>    <span class="i">$ref</span>-&gt;{<span class="q">&quot;susie&quot;</span>}[<span class="n">12</span>]</li></ol></pre><p>or a hash or array slice, such as:</p>
<pre class="verbatim"><ol><li>    <span class="i">@foo</span>[<span class="i">$bar</span><span class="cm">,</span> <span class="i">$baz</span><span class="cm">,</span> <span class="i">$xyzzy</span>]</li><li>    <span class="i">@</span>{<span class="i">$ref</span>-&gt;[<span class="n">12</span>]}{<span class="q">&quot;susie&quot;</span><span class="cm">,</span> <span class="q">&quot;queue&quot;</span>}</li></ol></pre></li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="%25s-argument-is-not-a-subroutine-name"></a><strong>%s argument is not a subroutine name</strong>
<p>(F) The argument to exists() for <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/exists.html">exists</a> <span class="i">&amp;sub</span></code>
 must be a subroutine
name, and not a subroutine call.  <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/exists.html">exists</a> <span class="i">&amp;sub</span><span class="s">(</span><span class="s">)</span></code>
 will generate this error.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="%25s-did-not-return-a-true-value"></a><strong>%s did not return a true value</strong>
<p>(F) A required (or used) file must return a true value to indicate that
it compiled correctly and ran its initialization code correctly.  It's
traditional to end such a file with a "1;", though any true value would
do.  See <a class='function-name' href="functions/require.html">require</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="%25s-found-where-operator-expected"></a><strong>%s found where operator expected</strong>
<p>(S) The Perl lexer knows whether to expect a term or an operator.  If it
sees what it knows to be a term when it was expecting to see an operator,
it gives you this warning.  Usually it indicates that an operator or
delimiter was omitted, such as a semicolon.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="%25s-had-compilation-errors"></a><strong>%s had compilation errors</strong>
<p>(F) The final summary message when a <code class="inline"><span class="w">perl</span> -c</code>
 fails.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="%25s-has-too-many-errors"></a><strong>%s has too many errors</strong>
<p>(F) The parser has given up trying to parse the program after 10 errors.
Further error messages would likely be uninformative.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="%25s-matches-null-string-many-times"></a><strong>%s matches null string many times</strong>
<p>(W regexp) The pattern you've specified would be an infinite loop if the
regular expression engine didn't specifically check for that.  See <a href="perlre.html">perlre</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="%25s-never-introduced"></a><strong>%s never introduced</strong>
<p>(S internal) The symbol in question was declared but somehow went out of scope
before it could possibly have been used.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="%25s-package-attribute-may-clash-with-future-reserved-word%3a-%25s"></a><strong>%s package attribute may clash with future reserved word: %s</strong>
<p>(W reserved) A lowercase attribute name was used that had a package-specific handler.
That name might have a meaning to Perl itself some day, even though it
doesn't yet.  Perhaps you should use a mixed-case attribute name, instead.
See <a href="https://search.cpan.org/perldoc/attributes">attributes</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="%25s-syntax-OK"></a><strong>%s syntax OK</strong>
<p>(F) The final summary message when a <code class="inline"><span class="w">perl</span> -c</code>
 succeeds.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="%25s%3a-Command-not-found"></a><strong>%s: Command not found</strong>
<p>(A) You've accidentally run your script through <strong>csh</strong> instead
of Perl.  Check the #! line, or manually feed your script into
Perl yourself.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="%25s%3a-Expression-syntax"></a><strong>%s: Expression syntax</strong>
<p>(A) You've accidentally run your script through <strong>csh</strong> instead
of Perl.  Check the #! line, or manually feed your script into
Perl yourself.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="%25s%3a-Undefined-variable"></a><strong>%s: Undefined variable</strong>
<p>(A) You've accidentally run your script through <strong>csh</strong> instead
of Perl.  Check the #! line, or manually feed your script into
Perl yourself.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="%25s%3a-not-found"></a><strong>%s: not found</strong>
<p>(A) You've accidentally run your script through the Bourne shell
instead of Perl.  Check the #! line, or manually feed your script
into Perl yourself.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="(in-cleanup)-%25s"></a><strong>(in cleanup) %s</strong>
<p>(W misc) This prefix usually indicates that a DESTROY() method raised
the indicated exception.  Since destructors are usually called by
the system at arbitrary points during execution, and often a vast
number of times, the warning is issued only once for any number
of failures that would otherwise result in the same message being
repeated.</p>
<p>Failure of user callbacks dispatched using the <code class="inline"><span class="w">G_KEEPERR</span></code>
 flag
could also result in this warning.  See <a href="perlcall.html#G_KEEPERR">G_KEEPERR in perlcall</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="(Missing-semicolon-on-previous-line%3f)"></a><strong>(Missing semicolon on previous line?)</strong>
<p>(S) This is an educated guess made in conjunction with the message "%s
found where operator expected".  Don't automatically put a semicolon on
the previous line just because you saw this message.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="*-P*-not-allowed-for-setuid%2fsetgid-script"></a><strong><strong>-P</strong> not allowed for setuid/setgid script</strong>
<p>(F) The script would have to be opened by the C preprocessor by name,
which provides a race condition that breaks security.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="-T-and--B-not-implemented-on-filehandles"></a><strong><code class="inline">-T</code>
 and <code class="inline">-B</code>
 not implemented on filehandles</strong>
<p>(F) Perl can't peek at the stdio buffer of filehandles when it doesn't
know about your kind of stdio.  You'll have to use a filename instead.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="-p-destination%3a-%25s"></a><strong><code class="inline">-p</code>
 destination: %s</strong>
<p>(F) An error occurred during the implicit output invoked by the <code class="inline">-p</code>

command-line switch.  (This output goes to STDOUT unless you've
redirected it with select().)</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="500-Server-error"></a><strong>500 Server error</strong>
<p>See Server error.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="%3f%2b*-follows-nothing-in-regexp"></a><strong>?+* follows nothing in regexp</strong>
<p>(F) You started a regular expression with a quantifier.  Backslash it
if you meant it literally.   See <a href="perlre.html">perlre</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="%40-outside-of-string"></a><strong>@ outside of string</strong>
<p>(F) You had a pack template that specified an absolute position outside
the string being unpacked.  See <a class='function-name' href="functions/pack.html">pack</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="%3c%3e-should-be-quotes"></a><strong>&lt;&gt; should be quotes</strong>
<p>(F) You wrote <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/require.html">require</a> <span class="q">&lt;file&gt;</span></code>
 when you should have written
<code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/require.html">require</a> <span class="q">&#39;file&#39;</span></code>
.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="accept()-on-closed-socket-%25s"></a><strong>accept() on closed socket %s</strong>
<p>(W closed) You tried to do an accept on a closed socket.  Did you forget to check
the return value of your socket() call?  See <a class='function-name' href="functions/accept.html">accept</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Allocation-too-large%3a-%25lx"></a><strong>Allocation too large: %lx</strong>
<p>(X) You can't allocate more than 64K on an MS-DOS machine.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Applying-%25s-to-%25s-will-act-on-scalar(%25s)"></a><strong>Applying %s to %s will act on scalar(%s)</strong>
<p>(W misc) The pattern match (//), substitution (s///), and transliteration (tr///)
operators work on scalar values.  If you apply one of them to an array
or a hash, it will convert the array or hash to a scalar value -- the
length of an array, or the population info of a hash -- and then work on
that scalar value.  This is probably not what you meant to do.  See
<a class='function-name' href="functions/grep.html">grep</a> and <a class='function-name' href="functions/map.html">map</a> for alternatives.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Arg-too-short-for-msgsnd"></a><strong>Arg too short for msgsnd</strong>
<p>(F) msgsnd() requires a string at least as long as sizeof(long).</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Ambiguous-use-of-%25s-resolved-as-%25s"></a><strong>Ambiguous use of %s resolved as %s</strong>
<p>(W ambiguous)(S) You said something that may not be interpreted the way
you thought.  Normally it's pretty easy to disambiguate it by supplying
a missing quote, operator, parenthesis pair or declaration.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Ambiguous-call-resolved-as-CORE%3a%3a%25s()%2c-qualify-as-such-or-use-%26"></a><strong>Ambiguous call resolved as CORE::%s(), qualify as such or use &amp;</strong>
<p>(W ambiguous) A subroutine you have declared has the same name as a Perl keyword,
and you have used the name without qualification for calling one or the
other.  Perl decided to call the builtin because the subroutine is
not imported.</p>
<p>To force interpretation as a subroutine call, either put an ampersand
before the subroutine name, or qualify the name with its package.
Alternatively, you can import the subroutine (or pretend that it's
imported with the <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/use.html">use</a> <span class="w">subs</span></code>
 pragma).</p>
<p>To silently interpret it as the Perl operator, use the <code class="inline"><span class="w">CORE::</span></code>
 prefix
on the operator (e.g. <code class="inline"><span class="i">CORE::log</span><span class="s">(</span><span class="i">$x</span><span class="s">)</span></code>
) or by declaring the subroutine
to be an object method (see <a href="perlsub.html#Subroutine-Attributes">Subroutine Attributes in perlsub</a>
or <a href="https://search.cpan.org/perldoc/attributes">attributes</a>).</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Args-must-match-%23!-line"></a><strong>Args must match #! line</strong>
<p>(F) The setuid emulator requires that the arguments Perl was invoked
with match the arguments specified on the #! line.  Since some systems
impose a one-argument limit on the #! line, try combining switches;
for example, turn <code class="inline">-w -<span class="w">U</span></code>
 into <code class="inline">-<span class="w">wU</span></code>
.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Argument-%22%25s%22-isn't-numeric%25s"></a><strong>Argument "%s" isn't numeric%s</strong>
<p>(W numeric) The indicated string was fed as an argument to an operator that
expected a numeric value instead.  If you're fortunate the message
will identify which operator was so unfortunate.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Array-%40%25s-missing-the-%40-in-argument-%25d-of-%25s()"></a><strong>Array @%s missing the @ in argument %d of %s()</strong>
<p>(D deprecated) Really old Perl let you omit the @ on array names in some spots.  This
is now heavily deprecated.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="assertion-botched%3a-%25s"></a><strong>assertion botched: %s</strong>
<p>(P) The malloc package that comes with Perl had an internal failure.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Assertion-failed%3a-file-%22%25s%22"></a><strong>Assertion failed: file "%s"</strong>
<p>(P) A general assertion failed.  The file in question must be examined.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Assignment-to-both-a-list-and-a-scalar"></a><strong>Assignment to both a list and a scalar</strong>
<p>(F) If you assign to a conditional operator, the 2nd and 3rd arguments
must either both be scalars or both be lists.  Otherwise Perl won't
know which context to supply to the right side.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Attempt-to-free-non-arena-SV%3a-0x%25lx"></a><strong>Attempt to free non-arena SV: 0x%lx</strong>
<p>(P internal) All SV objects are supposed to be allocated from arenas that will
be garbage collected on exit.  An SV was discovered to be outside any
of those arenas.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Attempt-to-free-nonexistent-shared-string"></a><strong>Attempt to free nonexistent shared string</strong>
<p>(P internal) Perl maintains a reference counted internal table of strings to
optimize the storage and access of hash keys and other strings.  This
indicates someone tried to decrement the reference count of a string
that can no longer be found in the table.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Attempt-to-free-temp-prematurely"></a><strong>Attempt to free temp prematurely</strong>
<p>(W debugging) Mortalized values are supposed to be freed by the free_tmps()
routine.  This indicates that something else is freeing the SV before
the free_tmps() routine gets a chance, which means that the free_tmps()
routine will be freeing an unreferenced scalar when it does try to free
it.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Attempt-to-free-unreferenced-glob-pointers"></a><strong>Attempt to free unreferenced glob pointers</strong>
<p>(P internal) The reference counts got screwed up on symbol aliases.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Attempt-to-free-unreferenced-scalar"></a><strong>Attempt to free unreferenced scalar</strong>
<p>(W internal) Perl went to decrement the reference count of a scalar to see if it
would go to 0, and discovered that it had already gone to 0 earlier,
and should have been freed, and in fact, probably was freed.  This
could indicate that SvREFCNT_dec() was called too many times, or that
SvREFCNT_inc() was called too few times, or that the SV was mortalized
when it shouldn't have been, or that memory has been corrupted.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Attempt-to-join-self"></a><strong>Attempt to join self</strong>
<p>(F) You tried to join a thread from within itself, which is an
impossible task.  You may be joining the wrong thread, or you may
need to move the join() to some other thread.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Attempt-to-pack-pointer-to-temporary-value"></a><strong>Attempt to pack pointer to temporary value</strong>
<p>(W pack) You tried to pass a temporary value (like the result of a
function, or a computed expression) to the "p" pack() template.  This
means the result contains a pointer to a location that could become
invalid anytime, even before the end of the current statement.  Use
literals or global values as arguments to the "p" pack() template to
avoid this warning.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Attempt-to-use-reference-as-lvalue-in-substr"></a><strong>Attempt to use reference as lvalue in substr</strong>
<p>(W substr) You supplied a reference as the first argument to substr() used
as an lvalue, which is pretty strange.  Perhaps you forgot to
dereference it first.  See <a class='function-name' href="functions/substr.html">substr</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Bad-arg-length-for-%25s%2c-is-%25d%2c-should-be-%25d"></a><strong>Bad arg length for %s, is %d, should be %d</strong>
<p>(F) You passed a buffer of the wrong size to one of msgctl(), semctl() or
shmctl().  In C parlance, the correct sizes are, respectively,
sizeof(struct msqid_ds *), sizeof(struct semid_ds *), and
sizeof(struct shmid_ds *).</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Bad-evalled-substitution-pattern"></a><strong>Bad evalled substitution pattern</strong>
<p>(F) You've used the /e switch to evaluate the replacement for a
substitution, but perl found a syntax error in the code to evaluate,
most likely an unexpected right brace '}'.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Bad-filehandle%3a-%25s"></a><strong>Bad filehandle: %s</strong>
<p>(F) A symbol was passed to something wanting a filehandle, but the symbol
has no filehandle associated with it.  Perhaps you didn't do an open(), or
did it in another package.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Bad-free()-ignored"></a><strong>Bad free() ignored</strong>
<p>(S malloc) An internal routine called free() on something that had never been
malloc()ed in the first place. Mandatory, but can be disabled by
setting environment variable <code class="inline"><span class="w">PERL_BADFREE</span></code>
 to 1.</p>
<p>This message can be quite often seen with DB_File on systems with
"hard" dynamic linking, like <code class="inline"><span class="w">AIX</span></code>
 and <code class="inline"><span class="w">OS</span>/<span class="n">2</span></code>
. It is a bug of
<code class="inline"><span class="w">Berkeley</span> <span class="w">DB</span></code>
 which is left unnoticed if <code class="inline"><span class="w">DB</span></code>
 uses <i>forgiving</i>
system malloc().</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Bad-hash"></a><strong>Bad hash</strong>
<p>(P) One of the internal hash routines was passed a null HV pointer.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Bad-index-while-coercing-array-into-hash"></a><strong>Bad index while coercing array into hash</strong>
<p>(F) The index looked up in the hash found as the 0'th element of a
pseudo-hash is not legal.  Index values must be at 1 or greater.
See <a href="perlref.html">perlref</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Bad-name-after-%25s%3a%3a"></a><strong>Bad name after %s::</strong>
<p>(F) You started to name a symbol by using a package prefix, and then didn't
finish the symbol.  In particular, you can't interpolate outside of quotes,
so</p>
<pre class="verbatim"><ol><li>    <span class="i">$var</span> = <span class="q">&#39;myvar&#39;</span><span class="sc">;</span></li><li>    <span class="i">$sym</span> = <span class="w">mypack::</span><span class="i">$var</span><span class="sc">;</span></li></ol></pre><p>is not the same as</p>

<li><a class='view-title' id="Bad-realloc()-ignored"></a><strong>Bad realloc() ignored</strong>
<p>(S malloc) An internal routine called realloc() on something that had never been
malloc()ed in the first place. Mandatory, but can be disabled by
setting environment variable <code class="inline"><span class="w">PERL_BADFREE</span></code>
 to 1.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Bad-symbol-for-array"></a><strong>Bad symbol for array</strong>
<p>(P) An internal request asked to add an array entry to something that
wasn't a symbol table entry.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Bad-symbol-for-filehandle"></a><strong>Bad symbol for filehandle</strong>
<p>(P) An internal request asked to add a filehandle entry to something that
wasn't a symbol table entry.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Bad-symbol-for-hash"></a><strong>Bad symbol for hash</strong>
<p>(P) An internal request asked to add a hash entry to something that
wasn't a symbol table entry.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Badly-placed-()'s"></a><strong>Badly placed ()'s</strong>
<p>(A) You've accidentally run your script through <strong>csh</strong> instead
of Perl.  Check the #! line, or manually feed your script into
Perl yourself.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Bareword-%22%25s%22-not-allowed-while-%22strict-subs%22-in-use"></a><strong>Bareword "%s" not allowed while "strict subs" in use</strong>
<p>(F) With "strict subs" in use, a bareword is only allowed as a
subroutine identifier, in curly brackets or to the left of the "=&gt;" symbol.
Perhaps you need to predeclare a subroutine?</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Bareword-%22%25s%22-refers-to-nonexistent-package"></a><strong>Bareword "%s" refers to nonexistent package</strong>
<p>(W bareword) You used a qualified bareword of the form <code class="inline"><span class="w">Foo::</span></code>
, but
the compiler saw no other uses of that namespace before that point.
Perhaps you need to predeclare a package?</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Bareword-found-in-conditional"></a><strong>Bareword found in conditional</strong>
<p>(W bareword) The compiler found a bareword where it expected a conditional,
which often indicates that an || or &amp;&amp; was parsed as part of the
last argument of the previous construct, for example:</p>
<pre class="verbatim"><ol><li>    <a class="l_k" href="functions/open.html">open</a> <span class="w">FOO</span> || <a class="l_k" href="functions/die.html">die</a><span class="sc">;</span></li></ol></pre><p>It may also indicate a misspelled constant that has been interpreted
as a bareword:</p>
<pre class="verbatim"><ol><li>    <a class="l_k" href="functions/use.html">use</a> <span class="w">constant</span> <span class="i">TYPO</span> <span class="cm">=&gt;</span> <span class="n">1</span><span class="sc">;</span></li><li>    if <span class="s">(</span><span class="w">TYOP</span><span class="s">)</span> <span class="s">{</span> <a class="l_k" href="functions/print.html">print</a> <span class="q">&quot;foo&quot;</span> <span class="s">}</span></li></ol></pre><p>The <code class="inline"><span class="w">strict</span></code>
 pragma is useful in avoiding such errors.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="BEGIN-failed--compilation-aborted"></a><strong>BEGIN failed--compilation aborted</strong>
<p>(F) An untrapped exception was raised while executing a BEGIN subroutine.
Compilation stops immediately and the interpreter is exited.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="BEGIN-not-safe-after-errors--compilation-aborted"></a><strong>BEGIN not safe after errors--compilation aborted</strong>
<p>(F) Perl found a <code class="inline">BEGIN <span class="s">{</span><span class="s">}</span></code>
 subroutine (or a <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/use.html">use</a></code> directive, which
implies a <code class="inline">BEGIN <span class="s">{</span><span class="s">}</span></code>
) after one or more compilation errors had
already occurred.  Since the intended environment for the <code class="inline">BEGIN <span class="s">{</span><span class="s">}</span></code>

could not be guaranteed (due to the errors), and since subsequent code
likely depends on its correct operation, Perl just gave up.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Binary-number-%3e-0b11111111111111111111111111111111-non-portable"></a><strong>Binary number &gt; 0b11111111111111111111111111111111 non-portable</strong>
<p>(W portable) The binary number you specified is larger than 2**32-1
(4294967295) and therefore non-portable between systems.  See
<a href="perlport.html">perlport</a> for more on portability concerns.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="bind()-on-closed-socket-%25s"></a><strong>bind() on closed socket %s</strong>
<p>(W closed) You tried to do a bind on a closed socket.  Did you forget to check
the return value of your socket() call?  See <a class='function-name' href="functions/bind.html">bind</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Bit-vector-size-%3e-32-non-portable"></a><strong>Bit vector size &gt; 32 non-portable</strong>
<p>(W portable) Using bit vector sizes larger than 32 is non-portable.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Bizarre-copy-of-%25s-in-%25s"></a><strong>Bizarre copy of %s in %s</strong>
<p>(P) Perl detected an attempt to copy an internal value that is not copiable.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Buffer-overflow-in-prime_env_iter%3a-%25s"></a><strong>Buffer overflow in prime_env_iter: %s</strong>
<p>(W internal) A warning peculiar to VMS.  While Perl was preparing to iterate over
%ENV, it encountered a logical name or symbol definition which was too long,
so it was truncated to the string shown.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Callback-called-exit"></a><strong>Callback called exit</strong>
<p>(F) A subroutine invoked from an external package via call_sv()
exited by calling exit.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Can't-%22goto%22-out-of-a-pseudo-block"></a><strong>Can't "goto" out of a pseudo block</strong>
<p>(F) A "goto" statement was executed to jump out of what might look
like a block, except that it isn't a proper block.  This usually
occurs if you tried to jump out of a sort() block or subroutine, which
is a no-no.  See <a class='function-name' href="functions/goto.html">goto</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Can't-%22goto%22-into-the-middle-of-a-foreach-loop"></a><strong>Can't "goto" into the middle of a foreach loop</strong>
<p>(F) A "goto" statement was executed to jump into the middle of a
foreach loop.  You can't get there from here.  See <a class='function-name' href="functions/goto.html">goto</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Can't-%22last%22-outside-a-loop-block"></a><strong>Can't "last" outside a loop block</strong>
<p>(F) A "last" statement was executed to break out of the current block,
except that there's this itty bitty problem called there isn't a
current block.  Note that an "if" or "else" block doesn't count as a
"loopish" block, as doesn't a block given to sort(), map() or grep().
You can usually double the curlies to get the same effect though,
because the inner curlies will be considered a block that loops once.
See <a class='function-name' href="functions/last.html">last</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Can't-%22next%22-outside-a-loop-block"></a><strong>Can't "next" outside a loop block</strong>
<p>(F) A "next" statement was executed to reiterate the current block, but
there isn't a current block.  Note that an "if" or "else" block doesn't
count as a "loopish" block, as doesn't a block given to sort(), map()
or grep().  You can usually double the curlies to get the same effect
though, because the inner curlies will be considered a block that
loops once.  See <a class='function-name' href="functions/next.html">next</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Can't-read-CRTL-environ"></a><strong>Can't read CRTL environ</strong>
<p>(S) A warning peculiar to VMS.  Perl tried to read an element of %ENV
from the CRTL's internal environment array and discovered the array was
missing.  You need to figure out where your CRTL misplaced its environ
or define <i>PERL_ENV_TABLES</i> (see <a href="perlvms.html">perlvms</a>) so that environ is not searched.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Can't-%22redo%22-outside-a-loop-block"></a><strong>Can't "redo" outside a loop block</strong>
<p>(F) A "redo" statement was executed to restart the current block, but
there isn't a current block.  Note that an "if" or "else" block doesn't
count as a "loopish" block, as doesn't a block given to sort(), map()
or grep().  You can usually double the curlies to get the same effect
though, because the inner curlies will be considered a block that
loops once.  See <a class='function-name' href="functions/redo.html">redo</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Can't-bless-non-reference-value"></a><strong>Can't bless non-reference value</strong>
<p>(F) Only hard references may be blessed.  This is how Perl "enforces"
encapsulation of objects.  See <a href="perlobj.html">perlobj</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Can't-break-at-that-line"></a><strong>Can't break at that line</strong>
<p>(S internal) A warning intended to only be printed while running within the debugger, indicating
the line number specified wasn't the location of a statement that could
be stopped at.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Can't-call-method-%22%25s%22-in-empty-package-%22%25s%22"></a><strong>Can't call method "%s" in empty package "%s"</strong>
<p>(F) You called a method correctly, and it correctly indicated a package
functioning as a class, but that package doesn't have ANYTHING defined
in it, let alone methods.  See <a href="perlobj.html">perlobj</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Can't-call-method-%22%25s%22-on-unblessed-reference"></a><strong>Can't call method "%s" on unblessed reference</strong>
<p>(F) A method call must know in what package it's supposed to run.  It
ordinarily finds this out from the object reference you supply, but
you didn't supply an object reference in this case.  A reference isn't
an object reference until it has been blessed.  See <a href="perlobj.html">perlobj</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Can't-call-method-%22%25s%22-without-a-package-or-object-reference"></a><strong>Can't call method "%s" without a package or object reference</strong>
<p>(F) You used the syntax of a method call, but the slot filled by the
object reference or package name contains an expression that returns
a defined value which is neither an object reference nor a package name.
Something like this will reproduce the error:</p>
<pre class="verbatim"><ol><li>    <span class="i">$BADREF</span> = <span class="n">42</span><span class="sc">;</span></li><li>    <span class="w">process</span> <span class="i">$BADREF</span> <span class="n">1</span><span class="cm">,</span><span class="n">2</span><span class="cm">,</span><span class="n">3</span><span class="sc">;</span></li><li>    <span class="i">$BADREF</span><span class="i">-&gt;process</span><span class="s">(</span><span class="n">1</span><span class="cm">,</span><span class="n">2</span><span class="cm">,</span><span class="n">3</span><span class="s">)</span><span class="sc">;</span></li></ol></pre></li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Can't-call-method-%22%25s%22-on-an-undefined-value"></a><strong>Can't call method "%s" on an undefined value</strong>
<p>(F) You used the syntax of a method call, but the slot filled by the
object reference or package name contains an undefined value.
Something like this will reproduce the error:</p>

<li><a class='view-title' id="Can't-chdir-to-%25s"></a><strong>Can't chdir to %s</strong>
<p>(F) You called <code class="inline"><span class="w">perl</span> -x<span class="q">/foo/</span><span class="w">bar</span></code>
, but <code class="inline"><span class="q">/foo/</span><span class="w">bar</span></code>
 is not a directory
that you can chdir to, possibly because it doesn't exist.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Can't-check-filesystem-of-script-%22%25s%22-for-nosuid"></a><strong>Can't check filesystem of script "%s" for nosuid</strong>
<p>(P) For some reason you can't check the filesystem of the script for nosuid.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Can't-coerce-%25s-to-integer-in-%25s"></a><strong>Can't coerce %s to integer in %s</strong>
<p>(F) Certain types of SVs, in particular real symbol table entries
(typeglobs), can't be forced to stop being what they are.  So you can't
say things like:</p>
<pre class="verbatim"><ol><li>    <span class="i">*foo</span> += <span class="n">1</span><span class="sc">;</span></li></ol></pre><p>You CAN say</p>
<pre class="verbatim"><ol><li>    <span class="i">$foo</span> = <span class="i">*foo</span><span class="sc">;</span></li><li>    <span class="i">$foo</span> += <span class="n">1</span><span class="sc">;</span></li></ol></pre><p>but then $foo no longer contains a glob.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Can't-coerce-%25s-to-number-in-%25s"></a><strong>Can't coerce %s to number in %s</strong>
<p>(F) Certain types of SVs, in particular real symbol table entries
(typeglobs), can't be forced to stop being what they are.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Can't-coerce-%25s-to-string-in-%25s"></a><strong>Can't coerce %s to string in %s</strong>
<p>(F) Certain types of SVs, in particular real symbol table entries
(typeglobs), can't be forced to stop being what they are.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Can't-coerce-array-into-hash"></a><strong>Can't coerce array into hash</strong>
<p>(F) You used an array where a hash was expected, but the array has no
information on how to map from keys to array indices.  You can do that
only with arrays that have a hash reference at index 0.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Can't-create-pipe-mailbox"></a><strong>Can't create pipe mailbox</strong>
<p>(P) An error peculiar to VMS.  The process is suffering from exhausted quotas
or other plumbing problems.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Can't-declare-class-for-non-scalar-%25s-in-%22%25s%22"></a><strong>Can't declare class for non-scalar %s in "%s"</strong>
<p>(S) Currently, only scalar variables can declared with a specific class
qualifier in a "my" or "our" declaration.  The semantics may be extended
for other types of variables in future.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Can't-declare-%25s-in-%22%25s%22"></a><strong>Can't declare %s in "%s"</strong>
<p>(F) Only scalar, array, and hash variables may be declared as "my" or
"our" variables.  They must have ordinary identifiers as names.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Can't-do-inplace-edit-on-%25s%3a-%25s"></a><strong>Can't do inplace edit on %s: %s</strong>
<p>(S inplace) The creation of the new file failed for the indicated reason.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Can't-do-inplace-edit-without-backup"></a><strong>Can't do inplace edit without backup</strong>
<p>(F) You're on a system such as MS-DOS that gets confused if you try reading
from a deleted (but still opened) file.  You have to say <code class="inline">-<span class="w">i</span>.<span class="w">bak</span></code>
, or some
such.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Can't-do-inplace-edit%3a-%25s-would-not-be-unique"></a><strong>Can't do inplace edit: %s would not be unique</strong>
<p>(S inplace) Your filesystem does not support filenames longer than 14
characters and Perl was unable to create a unique filename during
inplace editing with the <strong>-i</strong> switch.  The file was ignored.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Can't-do-inplace-edit%3a-%25s-is-not-a-regular-file"></a><strong>Can't do inplace edit: %s is not a regular file</strong>
<p>(S inplace) You tried to use the <strong>-i</strong> switch on a special file, such as a file in
/dev, or a FIFO.  The file was ignored.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Can't-do-setegid!"></a><strong>Can't do setegid!</strong>
<p>(P) The setegid() call failed for some reason in the setuid emulator
of suidperl.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Can't-do-seteuid!"></a><strong>Can't do seteuid!</strong>
<p>(P) The setuid emulator of suidperl failed for some reason.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Can't-do-setuid"></a><strong>Can't do setuid</strong>
<p>(F) This typically means that ordinary perl tried to exec suidperl to
do setuid emulation, but couldn't exec it.  It looks for a name of the
form sperl5.000 in the same directory that the perl executable resides
under the name perl5.000, typically /usr/local/bin on Unix machines.
If the file is there, check the execute permissions.  If it isn't, ask
your sysadmin why he and/or she removed it.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Can't-do-waitpid-with-flags"></a><strong>Can't do waitpid with flags</strong>
<p>(F) This machine doesn't have either waitpid() or wait4(), so only waitpid()
without flags is emulated.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Can't-do-%7bn%2cm%7d-with-n-%3e-m"></a><strong>Can't do {n,m} with n &gt; m</strong>
<p>(F) Minima must be less than or equal to maxima.  If you really want
your regexp to match something 0 times, just put {0}.  See <a href="perlre.html">perlre</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Can't-emulate--%25s-on-%23!-line"></a><strong>Can't emulate -%s on #! line</strong>
<p>(F) The #! line specifies a switch that doesn't make sense at this point.
For example, it'd be kind of silly to put a <strong>-x</strong> on the #! line.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Can't-exec-%22%25s%22%3a-%25s"></a><strong>Can't exec "%s": %s</strong>
<p>(W exec) An system(), exec(), or piped open call could not execute the named
program for the indicated reason.  Typical reasons include: the permissions
were wrong on the file, the file wasn't found in <code class="inline"><span class="i">$ENV</span>{<span class="w">PATH</span>}</code>
, the
executable in question was compiled for another architecture, or the
#! line in a script points to an interpreter that can't be run for
similar reasons.  (Or maybe your system doesn't support #! at all.)</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Can't-exec-%25s"></a><strong>Can't exec %s</strong>
<p>(F) Perl was trying to execute the indicated program for you because that's
what the #! line said.  If that's not what you wanted, you may need to
mention "perl" on the #! line somewhere.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Can't-execute-%25s"></a><strong>Can't execute %s</strong>
<p>(F) You used the <strong>-S</strong> switch, but the copies of the script to execute found
in the PATH did not have correct permissions.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Can't-find-%25s-on-PATH%2c-'.'-not-in-PATH"></a><strong>Can't find %s on PATH, '.' not in PATH</strong>
<p>(F) You used the <strong>-S</strong> switch, but the script to execute could not be found
in the PATH, or at least not with the correct permissions.  The script
exists in the current directory, but PATH prohibits running it.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Can't-find-%25s-on-PATH"></a><strong>Can't find %s on PATH</strong>
<p>(F) You used the <strong>-S</strong> switch, but the script to execute could not be found
in the PATH.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Can't-find-label-%25s"></a><strong>Can't find label %s</strong>
<p>(F) You said to goto a label that isn't mentioned anywhere that it's possible
for us to go to.  See <a class='function-name' href="functions/goto.html">goto</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Can't-find-string-terminator-%25s-anywhere-before-EOF"></a><strong>Can't find string terminator %s anywhere before EOF</strong>
<p>(F) Perl strings can stretch over multiple lines.  This message means that
the closing delimiter was omitted.  Because bracketed quotes count nesting
levels, the following is missing its final parenthesis:</p>
<pre class="verbatim"><ol><li>    <a class="l_k" href="functions/print.html">print</a> <span class="q">q(The character &#39;(&#39; starts a side comment.);</span></li></ol></pre><p>If you're getting this error from a here-document, you may have 
included unseen whitespace before or after your closing tag. A good 
programmer's editor will have a way to help you find these characters.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Can't-fork"></a><strong>Can't fork</strong>
<p>(F) A fatal error occurred while trying to fork while opening a pipeline.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Can't-get-filespec---stale-stat-buffer%3f"></a><strong>Can't get filespec - stale stat buffer?</strong>
<p>(S) A warning peculiar to VMS.  This arises because of the difference between
access checks under VMS and under the Unix model Perl assumes.  Under VMS,
access checks are done by filename, rather than by bits in the stat buffer, so
that ACLs and other protections can be taken into account.  Unfortunately, Perl
assumes that the stat buffer contains all the necessary information, and passes
it, instead of the filespec, to the access checking routine.  It will try to
retrieve the filespec using the device name and FID present in the stat buffer,
but this works only if you haven't made a subsequent call to the CRTL stat()
routine, because the device name is overwritten with each call.  If this warning
appears, the name lookup failed, and the access checking routine gave up and
returned FALSE, just to be conservative.  (Note: The access checking routine
knows about the Perl <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/stat.html">stat</a></code> operator and file tests, so you shouldn't ever
see this warning in response to a Perl command; it arises only if some internal
code takes stat buffers lightly.)</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Can't-get-pipe-mailbox-device-name"></a><strong>Can't get pipe mailbox device name</strong>
<p>(P) An error peculiar to VMS.  After creating a mailbox to act as a pipe, Perl
can't retrieve its name for later use.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Can't-get-SYSGEN-parameter-value-for-MAXBUF"></a><strong>Can't get SYSGEN parameter value for MAXBUF</strong>
<p>(P) An error peculiar to VMS.  Perl asked $GETSYI how big you want your
mailbox buffers to be, and didn't get an answer.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Can't-goto-subroutine-outside-a-subroutine"></a><strong>Can't goto subroutine outside a subroutine</strong>
<p>(F) The deeply magical "goto subroutine" call can only replace one subroutine
call for another.  It can't manufacture one out of whole cloth.  In general
you should be calling it out of only an AUTOLOAD routine anyway.  See
<a class='function-name' href="functions/goto.html">goto</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Can't-goto-subroutine-from-an-eval-string"></a><strong>Can't goto subroutine from an eval-string</strong>
<p>(F) The "goto subroutine" call can't be used to jump out of an eval "string".
(You can use it to jump out of an eval {BLOCK}, but you probably don't want to.)</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Can't-ignore-signal-CHLD%2c-forcing-to-default"></a><strong>Can't ignore signal CHLD, forcing to default</strong>
<p>(W signal) Perl has detected that it is being run with the SIGCHLD signal
(sometimes known as SIGCLD) disabled.  Since disabling this signal
will interfere with proper determination of exit status of child
processes, Perl has reset the signal to its default value.
This situation typically indicates that the parent program under
which Perl may be running (e.g. cron) is being very careless.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Can't-localize-through-a-reference"></a><strong>Can't localize through a reference</strong>
<p>(F) You said something like <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/local.html">local</a> <span class="i">$$ref</span></code>
, which Perl can't currently
handle, because when it goes to restore the old value of whatever $ref
pointed to after the scope of the local() is finished, it can't be
sure that $ref will still be a reference.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Can't-localize-lexical-variable-%25s"></a><strong>Can't localize lexical variable %s</strong>
<p>(F) You used local on a variable name that was previously declared as a
lexical variable using "my".  This is not allowed.  If you want to
localize a package variable of the same name, qualify it with the
package name.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Can't-localize-pseudo-hash-element"></a><strong>Can't localize pseudo-hash element</strong>
<p>(F) You said something like <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/local.html">local</a> <span class="i">$ar</span>-&gt;{<span class="q">&#39;key&#39;</span>}</code>
, where $ar is
a reference to a pseudo-hash.  That hasn't been implemented yet, but
you can get a similar effect by localizing the corresponding array
element directly -- <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/local.html">local</a> <span class="i">$ar</span>-&gt;[<span class="i">$ar</span>-&gt;[<span class="n">0</span>]{<span class="q">&#39;key&#39;</span>}]</code>
.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Can't-locate-auto%2f%25s.al-in-%40INC"></a><strong>Can't locate auto/%s.al in @INC</strong>
<p>(F) A function (or method) was called in a package which allows autoload,
but there is no function to autoload.  Most probable causes are a misprint
in a function/method name or a failure to <code class="inline"><span class="w">AutoSplit</span></code>
 the file, say, by
doing <code class="inline"><span class="w">make</span> <span class="w">install</span></code>
.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Can't-locate-%25s"></a><strong>Can't locate %s</strong>
<p>(F) You said to <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/do.html">do</a></code> (or <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/require.html">require</a></code>, or <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/use.html">use</a></code>) a file that couldn't be
found. Perl looks for the file in all the locations mentioned in @INC,
unless the file name included the full path to the file.  Perhaps you need
to set the PERL5LIB or PERL5OPT environment variable to say where the extra
library is, or maybe the script needs to add the library name to @INC.  Or
maybe you just misspelled the name of the file.  See <a class='function-name' href="functions/require.html">require</a>
and <a href="https://search.cpan.org/perldoc/lib">lib</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Can't-locate-object-method-%22%25s%22-via-package-%22%25s%22"></a><strong>Can't locate object method "%s" via package "%s"</strong>
<p>(F) You called a method correctly, and it correctly indicated a package
functioning as a class, but that package doesn't define that particular
method, nor does any of its base classes.  See <a href="perlobj.html">perlobj</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Can't-locate-package-%25s-for-%40%25s%3a%3aISA"></a><strong>Can't locate package %s for @%s::ISA</strong>
<p>(W syntax) The @ISA array contained the name of another package that doesn't seem
to exist.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Can't-make-list-assignment-to-%5c%25ENV-on-this-system"></a><strong>Can't make list assignment to \%ENV on this system</strong>
<p>(F) List assignment to %ENV is not supported on some systems, notably VMS.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Can't-modify-%25s-in-%25s"></a><strong>Can't modify %s in %s</strong>
<p>(F) You aren't allowed to assign to the item indicated, or otherwise try to
change it, such as with an auto-increment.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Can't-modify-non-lvalue-subroutine-call"></a><strong>Can't modify non-lvalue subroutine call</strong>
<p>(F) Subroutines meant to be used in lvalue context should be declared as
such, see <a href="perlsub.html#Lvalue-subroutines">Lvalue subroutines in perlsub</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Can't-modify-nonexistent-substring"></a><strong>Can't modify nonexistent substring</strong>
<p>(P) The internal routine that does assignment to a substr() was handed
a NULL.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Can't-msgrcv-to-read-only-var"></a><strong>Can't msgrcv to read-only var</strong>
<p>(F) The target of a msgrcv must be modifiable to be used as a receive
buffer.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Can't-open-%25s%3a-%25s"></a><strong>Can't open %s: %s</strong>
<p>(S inplace) The implicit opening of a file through use of the <code class="inline">&lt;&gt;</code>

filehandle, either implicitly under the <code class="inline">-<span class="w">n</span></code>
 or <code class="inline">-p</code>
 command-line
switches, or explicitly, failed for the indicated reason.  Usually this
is because you don't have read permission for a file which you named
on the command line.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Can't-open-bidirectional-pipe"></a><strong>Can't open bidirectional pipe</strong>
<p>(W pipe) You tried to say <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/open.html">open</a><span class="s">(</span><span class="w">CMD</span><span class="cm">,</span> <span class="q">&quot;|cmd|&quot;</span><span class="s">)</span></code>
, which is not supported.  You can
try any of several modules in the Perl library to do this, such as
IPC::Open2.  Alternately, direct the pipe's output to a file using "&gt;",
and then read it in under a different file handle.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Can't-open-error-file-%25s-as-stderr"></a><strong>Can't open error file %s as stderr</strong>
<p>(F) An error peculiar to VMS.  Perl does its own command line redirection, and
couldn't open the file specified after '2&gt;' or '2&gt;&gt;' on the
command line for writing.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Can't-open-input-file-%25s-as-stdin"></a><strong>Can't open input file %s as stdin</strong>
<p>(F) An error peculiar to VMS.  Perl does its own command line redirection, and
couldn't open the file specified after '&lt;' on the command line for reading.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Can't-open-output-file-%25s-as-stdout"></a><strong>Can't open output file %s as stdout</strong>
<p>(F) An error peculiar to VMS.  Perl does its own command line redirection, and
couldn't open the file specified after '&gt;' or '&gt;&gt;' on the command
line for writing.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Can't-open-output-pipe-(name%3a-%25s)"></a><strong>Can't open output pipe (name: %s)</strong>
<p>(P) An error peculiar to VMS.  Perl does its own command line redirection, and
couldn't open the pipe into which to send data destined for stdout.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Can't-open-perl-script-%22%25s%22%3a-%25s"></a><strong>Can't open perl script "%s": %s</strong>
<p>(F) The script you specified can't be opened for the indicated reason.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Can't-redefine-active-sort-subroutine-%25s"></a><strong>Can't redefine active sort subroutine %s</strong>
<p>(F) Perl optimizes the internal handling of sort subroutines and keeps
pointers into them.  You tried to redefine one such sort subroutine when it
was currently active, which is not allowed.  If you really want to do
this, you should write <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/sort.html">sort</a> <span class="s">{</span> <span class="i">&amp;func</span> <span class="s">}</span> <span class="i">@x</span></code>
 instead of <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/sort.html">sort</a> <span class="i">func</span> <span class="i">@x</span></code>
.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Can't-remove-%25s%3a-%25s%2c-skipping-file"></a><strong>Can't remove %s: %s, skipping file</strong>
<p>(S inplace) You requested an inplace edit without creating a backup file.  Perl
was unable to remove the original file to replace it with the modified
file.  The file was left unmodified.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Can't-rename-%25s-to-%25s%3a-%25s%2c-skipping-file"></a><strong>Can't rename %s to %s: %s, skipping file</strong>
<p>(S inplace) The rename done by the <strong>-i</strong> switch failed for some reason,
probably because you don't have write permission to the directory.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Can't-reopen-input-pipe-(name%3a-%25s)-in-binary-mode"></a><strong>Can't reopen input pipe (name: %s) in binary mode</strong>
<p>(P) An error peculiar to VMS.  Perl thought stdin was a pipe, and tried to
reopen it to accept binary data.  Alas, it failed.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Can't-reswap-uid-and-euid"></a><strong>Can't reswap uid and euid</strong>
<p>(P) The setreuid() call failed for some reason in the setuid emulator
of suidperl.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Can't-return-outside-a-subroutine"></a><strong>Can't return outside a subroutine</strong>
<p>(F) The return statement was executed in mainline code, that is, where
there was no subroutine call to return out of.  See <a href="perlsub.html">perlsub</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Can't-return-%25s-from-lvalue-subroutine"></a><strong>Can't return %s from lvalue subroutine</strong>
<p>(F) Perl detected an attempt to return illegal lvalues (such
as temporary or readonly values) from a subroutine used as an lvalue.
This is not allowed.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Can't-stat-script-%22%25s%22"></a><strong>Can't stat script "%s"</strong>
<p>(P) For some reason you can't fstat() the script even though you have
it open already.  Bizarre.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Can't-swap-uid-and-euid"></a><strong>Can't swap uid and euid</strong>
<p>(P) The setreuid() call failed for some reason in the setuid emulator
of suidperl.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Can't-take-log-of-%25g"></a><strong>Can't take log of %g</strong>
<p>(F) For ordinary real numbers, you can't take the logarithm of a
negative number or zero. There's a Math::Complex package that comes
standard with Perl, though, if you really want to do that for
the negative numbers.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Can't-take-sqrt-of-%25g"></a><strong>Can't take sqrt of %g</strong>
<p>(F) For ordinary real numbers, you can't take the square root of a
negative number.  There's a Math::Complex package that comes standard
with Perl, though, if you really want to do that.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Can't-undef-active-subroutine"></a><strong>Can't undef active subroutine</strong>
<p>(F) You can't undefine a routine that's currently running.  You can,
however, redefine it while it's running, and you can even undef the
redefined subroutine while the old routine is running.  Go figure.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Can't-unshift"></a><strong>Can't unshift</strong>
<p>(F) You tried to unshift an "unreal" array that can't be unshifted, such
as the main Perl stack.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Can't-upgrade-that-kind-of-scalar"></a><strong>Can't upgrade that kind of scalar</strong>
<p>(P) The internal sv_upgrade routine adds "members" to an SV, making
it into a more specialized kind of SV.  The top several SV types are
so specialized, however, that they cannot be interconverted.  This
message indicates that such a conversion was attempted.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Can't-upgrade-to-undef"></a><strong>Can't upgrade to undef</strong>
<p>(P) The undefined SV is the bottom of the totem pole, in the scheme
of upgradability.  Upgrading to undef indicates an error in the
code calling sv_upgrade.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Can't-use-%25%25!-because-Errno.pm-is-not-available"></a><strong>Can't use %%! because Errno.pm is not available</strong>
<p>(F) The first time the %! hash is used, perl automatically loads the
Errno.pm module. The Errno module is expected to tie the %! hash to
provide symbolic names for <code class="inline"><span class="i">$!</span></code>
 errno values.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Can't-use-%22my-%25s%22-in-sort-comparison"></a><strong>Can't use "my %s" in sort comparison</strong>
<p>(F) The global variables $a and $b are reserved for sort comparisons.
You mentioned $a or $b in the same line as the &lt;=&gt; or cmp operator,
and the variable had earlier been declared as a lexical variable.
Either qualify the sort variable with the package name, or rename the
lexical variable.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Can't-use-%25s-for-loop-variable"></a><strong>Can't use %s for loop variable</strong>
<p>(F) Only a simple scalar variable may be used as a loop variable on a foreach.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Can't-use-%25s-ref-as-%25s-ref"></a><strong>Can't use %s ref as %s ref</strong>
<p>(F) You've mixed up your reference types.  You have to dereference a
reference of the type needed.  You can use the ref() function to
test the type of the reference, if need be.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Can't-use-%5c%25c-to-mean-%24%25c-in-expression"></a><strong>Can't use \%c to mean $%c in expression</strong>
<p>(W syntax) In an ordinary expression, backslash is a unary operator that creates
a reference to its argument.  The use of backslash to indicate a backreference
to a matched substring is valid only as part of a regular expression pattern.
Trying to do this in ordinary Perl code produces a value that prints
out looking like SCALAR(0xdecaf).  Use the $1 form instead.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Can't-use-bareword-(%22%25s%22)-as-%25s-ref-while-%22strict-refs%22-in-use"></a><strong>Can't use bareword ("%s") as %s ref while "strict refs" in use</strong>
<p>(F) Only hard references are allowed by "strict refs".  Symbolic references
are disallowed.  See <a href="perlref.html">perlref</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Can't-use-string-(%22%25s%22)-as-%25s-ref-while-%22strict-refs%22-in-use"></a><strong>Can't use string ("%s") as %s ref while "strict refs" in use</strong>
<p>(F) Only hard references are allowed by "strict refs".  Symbolic references
are disallowed.  See <a href="perlref.html">perlref</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Can't-use-an-undefined-value-as-%25s-reference"></a><strong>Can't use an undefined value as %s reference</strong>
<p>(F) A value used as either a hard reference or a symbolic reference must
be a defined value.  This helps to delurk some insidious errors.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Can't-use-global-%25s-in-%22my%22"></a><strong>Can't use global %s in "my"</strong>
<p>(F) You tried to declare a magical variable as a lexical variable.  This is
not allowed, because the magic can be tied to only one location (namely
the global variable) and it would be incredibly confusing to have
variables in your program that looked like magical variables but
weren't.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Can't-use-subscript-on-%25s"></a><strong>Can't use subscript on %s</strong>
<p>(F) The compiler tried to interpret a bracketed expression as a
subscript.  But to the left of the brackets was an expression that
didn't look like an array reference, or anything else subscriptable.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Can't-weaken-a-nonreference"></a><strong>Can't weaken a nonreference</strong>
<p>(F) You attempted to weaken something that was not a reference.  Only
references can be weakened.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Can't-x%3d-to-read-only-value"></a><strong>Can't x= to read-only value</strong>
<p>(F) You tried to repeat a constant value (often the undefined value) with
an assignment operator, which implies modifying the value itself.
Perhaps you need to copy the value to a temporary, and repeat that.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Can't-find-an-opnumber-for-%22%25s%22"></a><strong>Can't find an opnumber for "%s"</strong>
<p>(F) A string of a form <code class="inline"><span class="w">CORE::word</span></code>
 was given to prototype(), but
there is no builtin with the name <code class="inline"><span class="w">word</span></code>
.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Can't-resolve-method-%60%25s'-overloading-%60%25s'-in-package-%60%25s'"></a><strong>Can't resolve method `%s' overloading `%s' in package `%s'</strong>
<p>(F|P) Error resolving overloading specified by a method name (as
opposed to a subroutine reference): no such method callable via the
package. If method name is <code class="inline"><span class="q">??</span>?</code>
, this is an internal error.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Character-class-%5b%3a%25s%3a%5d-unknown"></a><strong>Character class [:%s:] unknown</strong>
<p>(F) The class in the character class [: :] syntax is unknown.
See <a href="perlre.html">perlre</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Character-class-syntax-%5b%25s%5d-belongs-inside-character-classes"></a><strong>Character class syntax [%s] belongs inside character classes</strong>
<p>(W unsafe) The character class constructs [: :], [= =], and [. .]  go
<i>inside</i> character classes, the [] are part of the construct,
for example: /[012[:alpha:]345]/.  Note that [= =] and [. .]
are not currently implemented; they are simply placeholders for

</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Character-class-syntax-%5b.-.%5d-is-reserved-for-future-extensions"></a><strong>Character class syntax [. .] is reserved for future extensions</strong>
<p>(W regexp) Within regular expression character classes ([]) the syntax beginning
with "[." and ending with ".]" is reserved for future extensions.
If you need to represent those character sequences inside a regular

backslash: "\[." and ".\]".</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Character-class-syntax-%5b%3d-%3d%5d-is-reserved-for-future-extensions"></a><strong>Character class syntax [= =] is reserved for future extensions</strong>
<p>(W regexp) Within regular expression character classes ([]) the syntax

</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Close-on-unopened-file-%3c%25s%3e"></a><strong>Close on unopened file &lt;%s&gt;</strong>
<p>(W unopened) You tried to close a filehandle that was never opened.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Compilation-failed-in-require"></a><strong>Compilation failed in require</strong>
<p>(F) Perl could not compile a file specified in a <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/require.html">require</a></code> statement.
Perl uses this generic message when none of the errors that it encountered
were severe enough to halt compilation immediately.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Complex-regular-subexpression-recursion-limit-(%25d)-exceeded"></a><strong>Complex regular subexpression recursion limit (%d) exceeded</strong>
<p>(W regexp) The regular expression engine uses recursion in complex situations
where back-tracking is required.  Recursion depth is limited to 32766,
or perhaps less in architectures where the stack cannot grow
arbitrarily.  ("Simple" and "medium" situations are handled without
recursion and are not subject to a limit.)  Try shortening the string
under examination; looping in Perl code (e.g. with <code class="inline">while</code>
) rather
than in the regular expression engine; or rewriting the regular
expression so that it is simpler or backtracks less.  (See <a href="perlbook.html">perlbook</a>
for information on <i>Mastering Regular Expressions</i>.)</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="connect()-on-closed-socket-%25s"></a><strong>connect() on closed socket %s</strong>
<p>(W closed) You tried to do a connect on a closed socket.  Did you forget to check
the return value of your socket() call?  See <a class='function-name' href="functions/connect.html">connect</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Constant-is-not-%25s-reference"></a><strong>Constant is not %s reference</strong>
<p>(F) A constant value (perhaps declared using the <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/use.html">use</a> <span class="w">constant</span></code>
 pragma)
is being dereferenced, but it amounts to the wrong type of reference.  The
message indicates the type of reference that was expected. This usually
indicates a syntax error in dereferencing the constant value.
See <a href="perlsub.html#Constant-Functions">Constant Functions in perlsub</a> and <a href="https://search.cpan.org/perldoc/constant">constant</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Constant-subroutine-%25s-redefined"></a><strong>Constant subroutine %s redefined</strong>
<p>(S|W redefine) You redefined a subroutine which had previously been eligible for
inlining.  See <a href="perlsub.html#Constant-Functions">Constant Functions in perlsub</a> for commentary and
workarounds.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Constant-subroutine-%25s-undefined"></a><strong>Constant subroutine %s undefined</strong>
<p>(W misc) You undefined a subroutine which had previously been eligible for
inlining.  See <a href="perlsub.html#Constant-Functions">Constant Functions in perlsub</a> for commentary and
workarounds.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="constant(%25s)%3a-%25s"></a><strong>constant(%s): %s</strong>
<p>(F) The parser found inconsistencies either while attempting to define an
overloaded constant, or when trying to find the character name specified
in the <code class="inline">\<span class="i">N</span><span class="s">{</span>...<span class="s">}</span></code>
 escape.  Perhaps you forgot to load the corresponding
<code class="inline"><span class="w">overload</span></code>

 pragma?  See <a href="https://search.cpan.org/perldoc/charnames">charnames</a> and <a href="https://search.cpan.org/perldoc/overload">overload</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Copy-method-did-not-return-a-reference"></a><strong>Copy method did not return a reference</strong>
<p>(F) The method which overloads "=" is buggy. See <a href="https://search.cpan.org/perldoc/overload#Copy-Constructor">Copy Constructor in overload</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="CORE%3a%3a%25s-is-not-a-keyword"></a><strong>CORE::%s is not a keyword</strong>
<p>(F) The CORE:: namespace is reserved for Perl keywords.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Corrupt-malloc-ptr-0x%25lx-at-0x%25lx"></a><strong>Corrupt malloc ptr 0x%lx at 0x%lx</strong>
<p>(P) The malloc package that comes with Perl had an internal failure.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="corrupted-regexp-pointers"></a><strong>corrupted regexp pointers</strong>
<p>(P) The regular expression engine got confused by what the regular
expression compiler gave it.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="corrupted-regexp-program"></a><strong>corrupted regexp program</strong>
<p>(P) The regular expression engine got passed a regexp program without
a valid magic number.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Deep-recursion-on-subroutine-%22%25s%22"></a><strong>Deep recursion on subroutine "%s"</strong>
<p>(W recursion) This subroutine has called itself (directly or indirectly) 100
times more than it has returned.  This probably indicates an infinite
recursion, unless you're writing strange benchmark programs, in which
case it indicates something else.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="defined(%40array)-is-deprecated"></a><strong>defined(@array) is deprecated</strong>
<p>(D deprecated) defined() is not usually useful on arrays because it checks for an
undefined <i>scalar</i> value.  If you want to see if the array is empty,
just use <code class="inline">if <span class="s">(</span><span class="i">@array</span><span class="s">)</span> <span class="s">{</span> <span class="c"># not empty }</span></code>
 for example.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="defined(%25hash)-is-deprecated"></a><strong>defined(%hash) is deprecated</strong>
<p>(D deprecated) defined() is not usually useful on hashes because it checks for an
undefined <i>scalar</i> value.  If you want to see if the hash is empty,
just use <code class="inline">if <span class="s">(</span><span class="i">%hash</span><span class="s">)</span> <span class="s">{</span> <span class="c"># not empty }</span></code>
 for example.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Delimiter-for-here-document-is-too-long"></a><strong>Delimiter for here document is too long</strong>
<p>(F) In a here document construct like <code class="inline"><span class="h">&lt;&lt;FOO</span></code>
, the label
<code class="inline"><span class="w">FOO</span></code>
 is too long for Perl to handle.  You have to be seriously
twisted to write code that triggers this error.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Did-not-produce-a-valid-header"></a><strong>Did not produce a valid header</strong>
<p>See Server error.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="(Did-you-mean-%26%25s-instead%3f)"></a><strong>(Did you mean &amp;%s instead?)</strong>
<p>(W) You probably referred to an imported subroutine &amp;FOO as $FOO or some such.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="(Did-you-mean-%22local%22-instead-of-%22our%22%3f)"></a><strong>(Did you mean "local" instead of "our"?)</strong>
<p>(W misc) Remember that "our" does not localize the declared global variable.
You have declared it again in the same lexical scope, which seems superfluous.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="(Did-you-mean-%24-or-%40-instead-of-%25%3f)"></a><strong>(Did you mean $ or @ instead of %?)</strong>
<p>(W) You probably said %hash{$key} when you meant $hash{$key} or @hash{@keys}.
On the other hand, maybe you just meant %hash and got carried away.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Died"></a><strong>Died</strong>
<p>(F) You passed die() an empty string (the equivalent of <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/die.html">die</a> <span class="q">&quot;&quot;</span></code>
) or
you called it with no args and both <code class="inline"><span class="i">$@</span></code>
 and <code class="inline"><span class="i">$_</span></code>
 were empty.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="(Do-you-need-to-predeclare-%25s%3f)"></a><strong>(Do you need to predeclare %s?)</strong>
<p>(S) This is an educated guess made in conjunction with the message "%s
found where operator expected".  It often means a subroutine or module
name is being referenced that hasn't been declared yet.  This may be
because of ordering problems in your file, or because of a missing
"sub", "package", "require", or "use" statement.  If you're
referencing something that isn't defined yet, you don't actually have
to define the subroutine or package before the current location.  You
can use an empty "sub foo;" or "package FOO;" to enter a "forward"
declaration.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Document-contains-no-data"></a><strong>Document contains no data</strong>
<p>See Server error.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Don't-know-how-to-handle-magic-of-type-'%25s'"></a><strong>Don't know how to handle magic of type '%s'</strong>
<p>(P) The internal handling of magical variables has been cursed.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="do_study%3a-out-of-memory"></a><strong>do_study: out of memory</strong>
<p>(P) This should have been caught by safemalloc() instead.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Duplicate-free()-ignored"></a><strong>Duplicate free() ignored</strong>
<p>(S malloc) An internal routine called free() on something that had already
been freed.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="elseif-should-be-elsif"></a><strong>elseif should be elsif</strong>
<p>(S) There is no keyword "elseif" in Perl because Larry thinks it's
ugly.  Your code will be interpreted as an attempt to call a method
named "elseif" for the class returned by the following block.  This is
unlikely to be what you want.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="%25s-failed--call-queue-aborted"></a><strong>%s failed--call queue aborted</strong>
<p>(F) An untrapped exception was raised while executing a CHECK, INIT, or
END subroutine.  Processing of the remainder of the queue of such
routines has been prematurely ended.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="entering-effective-%25s-failed"></a><strong>entering effective %s failed</strong>
<p>(F) While under the <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/use.html">use</a> <span class="w">filetest</span></code>
 pragma, switching the real and
effective uids or gids failed.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Error-converting-file-specification-%25s"></a><strong>Error converting file specification %s</strong>
<p>(F) An error peculiar to VMS.  Because Perl may have to deal with file
specifications in either VMS or Unix syntax, it converts them to a
single form when it must operate on them directly.  Either you've
passed an invalid file specification to Perl, or you've found a
case the conversion routines don't handle.  Drat.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="%25s%3a-Eval-group-in-insecure-regular-expression"></a><strong>%s: Eval-group in insecure regular expression</strong>
<p>(F) Perl detected tainted data when trying to compile a regular expression
that contains the <code class="inline"><span class="s">(</span><span class="q">?{ ... })</span></code>
 zero-width assertion, which is unsafe.
See <a href="perlre.html#(%3f%7b-code-%7d)">(?{ code }) in perlre</a>, and <a href="perlsec.html">perlsec</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="%25s%3a-Eval-group-not-allowed%2c-use-re-'eval'"></a><strong>%s: Eval-group not allowed, use re 'eval'</strong>
<p>(F) A regular expression contained the <code class="inline"><span class="s">(</span><span class="q">?{ ... })</span></code>
 zero-width assertion,
but that construct is only allowed when the <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/use.html">use</a> <span class="w">re</span> <span class="q">&#39;eval&#39;</span></code>
 pragma is
in effect.  See <a href="perlre.html#(%3f%7b-code-%7d)">(?{ code }) in perlre</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="%25s%3a-Eval-group-not-allowed-at-run-time"></a><strong>%s: Eval-group not allowed at run time</strong>
<p>(F) Perl tried to compile a regular expression containing the <code class="inline"><span class="s">(</span><span class="q">?{ ... })</span></code>

zero-width assertion at run time, as it would when the pattern contains
interpolated values.  Since that is a security risk, it is not allowed.
If you insist, you may still do this by explicitly building the pattern
from an interpolated string at run time and using that in an eval().
See <a href="perlre.html#(%3f%7b-code-%7d)">(?{ code }) in perlre</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Excessively-long-%3c%3e-operator"></a><strong>Excessively long &lt;&gt; operator</strong>
<p>(F) The contents of a &lt;&gt; operator may not exceed the maximum size of a
Perl identifier.  If you're just trying to glob a long list of
filenames, try using the glob() operator, or put the filenames into a
variable and glob that.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Execution-of-%25s-aborted-due-to-compilation-errors"></a><strong>Execution of %s aborted due to compilation errors</strong>
<p>(F) The final summary message when a Perl compilation fails.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Exiting-eval-via-%25s"></a><strong>Exiting eval via %s</strong>
<p>(W exiting) You are exiting an eval by unconventional means, such as
a goto, or a loop control statement.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Exiting-format-via-%25s"></a><strong>Exiting format via %s</strong>
<p>(W exiting) You are exiting an eval by unconventional means, such as
a goto, or a loop control statement.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Exiting-pseudo-block-via-%25s"></a><strong>Exiting pseudo-block via %s</strong>
<p>(W exiting) You are exiting a rather special block construct (like a sort block or
subroutine) by unconventional means, such as a goto, or a loop control
statement.  See <a class='function-name' href="functions/sort.html">sort</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Exiting-subroutine-via-%25s"></a><strong>Exiting subroutine via %s</strong>
<p>(W exiting) You are exiting a subroutine by unconventional means, such as
a goto, or a loop control statement.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Exiting-substitution-via-%25s"></a><strong>Exiting substitution via %s</strong>
<p>(W exiting) You are exiting a substitution by unconventional means, such as
a return, a goto, or a loop control statement.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Explicit-blessing-to-''-(assuming-package-main)"></a><strong>Explicit blessing to '' (assuming package main)</strong>
<p>(W misc) You are blessing a reference to a zero length string.  This has
the effect of blessing the reference into the package main.  This is
usually not what you want.  Consider providing a default target
package, e.g. bless($ref, $p || 'MyPackage');</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="false-%5b%5d-range-%22%25s%22-in-regexp"></a><strong>false [] range "%s" in regexp</strong>
<p>(W regexp) A character class range must start and end at a literal character, not
another character class like <code class="inline">\<span class="w">d</span></code>
 or <code class="inline"><span class="s">[</span><span class="co">:</span><span class="w">alpha</span><span class="co">:</span><span class="s">]</span></code>
.  The "-" in your false
range is interpreted as a literal "-".  Consider quoting the "-",  "\-".
See <a href="perlre.html">perlre</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Fatal-VMS-error-at-%25s%2c-line-%25d"></a><strong>Fatal VMS error at %s, line %d</strong>
<p>(P) An error peculiar to VMS.  Something untoward happened in a VMS system
service or RTL routine; Perl's exit status should provide more details.  The
filename in "at %s" and the line number in "line %d" tell you which section of
the Perl source code is distressed.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="fcntl-is-not-implemented"></a><strong>fcntl is not implemented</strong>
<p>(F) Your machine apparently doesn't implement fcntl().  What is this, a
PDP-11 or something?</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Filehandle-%25s-never-opened"></a><strong>Filehandle %s never opened</strong>
<p>(W unopened) An I/O operation was attempted on a filehandle that was never initialized.
You need to do an open() or a socket() call, or call a constructor from
the FileHandle package.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Filehandle-%25s-opened-only-for-input"></a><strong>Filehandle %s opened only for input</strong>
<p>(W io) You tried to write on a read-only filehandle.  If you
intended it to be a read-write filehandle, you needed to open it with
"+&lt;" or "+&gt;" or "+&gt;&gt;" instead of with "&lt;" or nothing.  If
you intended only to write the file, use "&gt;" or "&gt;&gt;".  See
<a class='function-name' href="functions/open.html">open</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Filehandle-%25s-opened-only-for-output"></a><strong>Filehandle %s opened only for output</strong>
<p>(W io) You tried to read from a filehandle opened only for writing.  If you
intended it to be a read/write filehandle, you needed to open it with
"+&lt;" or "+&gt;" or "+&gt;&gt;" instead of with "&lt;" or nothing.  If
you intended only to read from the file, use "&lt;".  See
<a class='function-name' href="functions/open.html">open</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Final-%24-should-be-%5c%24-or-%24name"></a><strong>Final $ should be \$ or $name</strong>
<p>(F) You must now decide whether the final $ in a string was meant to be
a literal dollar sign, or was meant to introduce a variable name
that happens to be missing.  So you have to put either the backslash or
the name.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Final-%40-should-be-%5c%40-or-%40name"></a><strong>Final @ should be \@ or @name</strong>
<p>(F) You must now decide whether the final @ in a string was meant to be
a literal "at" sign, or was meant to introduce a variable name
that happens to be missing.  So you have to put either the backslash or
the name.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="flock()-on-closed-filehandle-%25s"></a><strong>flock() on closed filehandle %s</strong>
<p>(W closed) The filehandle you're attempting to flock() got itself closed some
time before now.  Check your logic flow.  flock() operates on filehandles.
Are you attempting to call flock() on a dirhandle by the same name?</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Format-%25s-redefined"></a><strong>Format %s redefined</strong>
<p>(W redefine) You redefined a format.  To suppress this warning, say</p>
<pre class="verbatim"><ol><li>    <span class="s">{</span></li><li>	<a class="l_k" href="functions/no.html">no</a> <span class="w">warnings</span><span class="sc">;</span></li><li>	<a class="l_k" href="functions/eval.html">eval</a> <span class="q">&quot;format NAME =...&quot;</span><span class="sc">;</span></li><li>    <span class="s">}</span></li></ol></pre></li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Format-not-terminated"></a><strong>Format not terminated</strong>
<p>(F) A format must be terminated by a line with a solitary dot.  Perl got
to the end of your file without finding such a line.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Found-%3d-in-conditional%2c-should-be-%3d%3d"></a><strong>Found = in conditional, should be ==</strong>
<p>(W syntax) You said</p>
<pre class="verbatim"><ol><li>    if <span class="s">(</span><span class="i">$foo</span> = <span class="n">123</span><span class="s">)</span></li></ol></pre><p>when you meant</p>
<pre class="verbatim"><ol><li>    if <span class="s">(</span><span class="i">$foo</span> == <span class="n">123</span><span class="s">)</span></li></ol></pre><p>(or something like that).</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="gdbm-store-returned-%25d%2c-errno-%25d%2c-key-%22%25s%22"></a><strong>gdbm store returned %d, errno %d, key "%s"</strong>
<p>(S) A warning from the GDBM_File extension that a store failed.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="gethostent-not-implemented"></a><strong>gethostent not implemented</strong>
<p>(F) Your C library apparently doesn't implement gethostent(), probably
because if it did, it'd feel morally obligated to return every hostname
on the Internet.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="get%25sname()-on-closed-socket-%25s"></a><strong>get%sname() on closed socket %s</strong>
<p>(W closed) You tried to get a socket or peer socket name on a closed socket.
Did you forget to check the return value of your socket() call?</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="getpwnam-returned-invalid-UIC-%25%23o-for-user-%22%25s%22"></a><strong>getpwnam returned invalid UIC %#o for user "%s"</strong>
<p>(S) A warning peculiar to VMS.  The call to <code class="inline"><span class="w">sys</span><span class="i">$getuai</span></code>
 underlying the
<code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/getpwnam.html">getpwnam</a></code> operator returned an invalid UIC.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="glob-failed-(%25s)"></a><strong>glob failed (%s)</strong>
<p>(W glob) Something went wrong with the external program(s) used for <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/glob.html">glob</a></code>
and <code class="inline"><span class="q">&lt;*.c&gt;</span></code>
.  Usually, this means that you supplied a <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/glob.html">glob</a></code>
pattern that caused the external program to fail and exit with a nonzero
status.  If the message indicates that the abnormal exit resulted in a
coredump, this may also mean that your csh (C shell) is broken.  If so,
you should change all of the csh-related variables in config.sh:  If you
have tcsh, make the variables refer to it as if it were csh (e.g.
<code class="inline"><span class="w">full_csh</span>=<span class="q">&#39;/usr/bin/tcsh&#39;</span></code>
); otherwise, make them all empty (except that
<code class="inline"><span class="w">d_csh</span></code>
 should be <code class="inline"><span class="q">&#39;undef&#39;</span></code>
) so that Perl will think csh is missing.
In either case, after editing config.sh, run <code class="inline">.<span class="q">/Configure -S</span></code>
 and
rebuild Perl.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Glob-not-terminated"></a><strong>Glob not terminated</strong>
<p>(F) The lexer saw a left angle bracket in a place where it was expecting
a term, so it's looking for the corresponding right angle bracket, and not
finding it.  Chances are you left some needed parentheses out earlier in
the line, and you really meant a "less than".</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Global-symbol-%22%25s%22-requires-explicit-package-name"></a><strong>Global symbol "%s" requires explicit package name</strong>
<p>(F) You've said "use strict vars", which indicates that all variables
must either be lexically scoped (using "my"), declared beforehand using
"our", or explicitly qualified to say which package the global variable
is in (using "::").</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="goto-must-have-label"></a><strong>goto must have label</strong>
<p>(F) Unlike with "next" or "last", you're not allowed to goto an
unspecified destination.  See <a class='function-name' href="functions/goto.html">goto</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Had-to-create-%25s-unexpectedly"></a><strong>Had to create %s unexpectedly</strong>
<p>(S internal) A routine asked for a symbol from a symbol table that ought to have
existed already, but for some reason it didn't, and had to be created on
an emergency basis to prevent a core dump.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Hash-%25%25s-missing-the-%25-in-argument-%25d-of-%25s()"></a><strong>Hash %%s missing the % in argument %d of %s()</strong>
<p>(D deprecated) Really old Perl let you omit the % on hash names in some spots.  This
is now heavily deprecated.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Hexadecimal-number-%3e-0xffffffff-non-portable"></a><strong>Hexadecimal number &gt; 0xffffffff non-portable</strong>
<p>(W portable) The hexadecimal number you specified is larger than 2**32-1
(4294967295) and therefore non-portable between systems.  See
<a href="perlport.html">perlport</a> for more on portability concerns.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Identifier-too-long"></a><strong>Identifier too long</strong>
<p>(F) Perl limits identifiers (names for variables, functions, etc.) to
about 250 characters for simple names, and somewhat more for compound
names (like <code class="inline"><span class="i">$A::B</span></code>
).  You've exceeded Perl's limits.  Future
versions of Perl are likely to eliminate these arbitrary limitations.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Ill-formed-CRTL-environ-value-%22%25s%22"></a><strong>Ill-formed CRTL environ value "%s"</strong>
<p>(W internal) A warning peculiar to VMS.  Perl tried to read the CRTL's internal
environ array, and encountered an element without the <code class="inline">=</code>
 delimiter
used to spearate keys from values.  The element is ignored.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Ill-formed-message-in-prime_env_iter%3a-%7c%25s%7c"></a><strong>Ill-formed message in prime_env_iter: |%s|</strong>
<p>(W internal) A warning peculiar to VMS.  Perl tried to read a logical name
or CLI symbol definition when preparing to iterate over %ENV, and
didn't see the expected delimiter between key and value, so the
line was ignored.</p>

<li><a class='view-title' id="Illegal-character-%25s-(carriage-return)"></a><strong>Illegal character %s (carriage return)</strong>
<p>(F) Perl normally treats carriage returns in the program text as it
would any other whitespace, which means you should never see this
error when Perl was built using standard options.  For some reason,
your version of Perl appears to have been built without this support.
Talk to your Perl administrator.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Illegal-division-by-zero"></a><strong>Illegal division by zero</strong>
<p>(F) You tried to divide a number by 0.  Either something was wrong in your
logic, or you need to put a conditional in to guard against meaningless input.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Illegal-modulus-zero"></a><strong>Illegal modulus zero</strong>
<p>(F) You tried to divide a number by 0 to get the remainder.  Most numbers
don't take to this kindly.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Illegal-binary-digit-%25s"></a><strong>Illegal binary digit %s</strong>
<p>(F) You used a digit other than 0 or 1 in a binary number.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Illegal-octal-digit-%25s"></a><strong>Illegal octal digit %s</strong>
<p>(F) You used an 8 or 9 in a octal number.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Illegal-binary-digit-%25s-ignored"></a><strong>Illegal binary digit %s ignored</strong>
<p>(W digit) You may have tried to use a digit other than 0 or 1 in a binary number.
Interpretation of the binary number stopped before the offending digit.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Illegal-octal-digit-%25s-ignored"></a><strong>Illegal octal digit %s ignored</strong>
<p>(W digit) You may have tried to use an 8 or 9 in a octal number.  Interpretation
of the octal number stopped before the 8 or 9.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Illegal-hexadecimal-digit-%25s-ignored"></a><strong>Illegal hexadecimal digit %s ignored</strong>
<p>(W digit) You may have tried to use a character other than 0 - 9 or A - F, a - f
in a hexadecimal number.  Interpretation of the hexadecimal number stopped
before the illegal character.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Illegal-number-of-bits-in-vec"></a><strong>Illegal number of bits in vec</strong>
<p>(F) The number of bits in vec() (the third argument) must be a power of
two from 1 to 32 (or 64, if your platform supports that).</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Illegal-switch-in-PERL5OPT%3a-%25s"></a><strong>Illegal switch in PERL5OPT: %s</strong>
<p>(X) The PERL5OPT environment variable may only be used to set the
following switches: <strong>-[DIMUdmw]</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="In-string%2c-%40%25s-now-must-be-written-as-%5c%40%25s"></a><strong>In string, @%s now must be written as \@%s</strong>
<p>(F) It used to be that Perl would try to guess whether you wanted an
array interpolated or a literal @.  It did this when the string was first
used at runtime.  Now strings are parsed at compile time, and ambiguous
instances of @ must be disambiguated, either by prepending a backslash to
indicate a literal, or by declaring (or using) the array within the
program before the string (lexically).  (Someday it will simply assume
that an unbackslashed @ interpolates an array.)</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Insecure-dependency-in-%25s"></a><strong>Insecure dependency in %s</strong>
<p>(F) You tried to do something that the tainting mechanism didn't like.
The tainting mechanism is turned on when you're running setuid or setgid,
or when you specify <strong>-T</strong> to turn it on explicitly.  The tainting mechanism
labels all data that's derived directly or indirectly from the user,
who is considered to be unworthy of your trust.  If any such data is
used in a "dangerous" operation, you get this error.  See <a href="perlsec.html">perlsec</a>
for more information.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Insecure-directory-in-%25s"></a><strong>Insecure directory in %s</strong>
<p>(F) You can't use system(), exec(), or a piped open in a setuid or setgid
script if <code class="inline"><span class="i">$ENV</span>{<span class="w">PATH</span>}</code>
 contains a directory that is writable by the world.
See <a href="perlsec.html">perlsec</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Insecure-%24ENV%7b%25s%7d-while-running-%25s"></a><strong>Insecure $ENV{%s} while running %s</strong>
<p>(F) You can't use system(), exec(), or a piped open in a setuid or
setgid script if any of <code class="inline"><span class="i">$ENV</span>{<span class="w">PATH</span>}</code>
, <code class="inline"><span class="i">$ENV</span>{<span class="w">IFS</span>}</code>
, <code class="inline"><span class="i">$ENV</span>{<span class="w">CDPATH</span>}</code>
,
<code class="inline"><span class="i">$ENV</span>{<span class="w">ENV</span>}</code>
 or <code class="inline"><span class="i">$ENV</span>{<span class="w">BASH_ENV</span>}</code>
 are derived from data supplied (or
potentially supplied) by the user.  The script must set the path to a
known value, using trustworthy data.  See <a href="perlsec.html">perlsec</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Integer-overflow-in-%25s-number"></a><strong>Integer overflow in %s number</strong>
<p>(W overflow) The hexadecimal, octal or binary number you have specified either
as a literal or as an argument to hex() or oct() is too big for your
architecture, and has been converted to a floating point number.  On a
32-bit architecture the largest hexadecimal, octal or binary number
representable without overflow is 0xFFFFFFFF, 037777777777, or
0b11111111111111111111111111111111 respectively.  Note that Perl
transparently promotes all numbers to a floating point representation
internally--subject to loss of precision errors in subsequent
operations.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Internal-inconsistency-in-tracking-vforks"></a><strong>Internal inconsistency in tracking vforks</strong>
<p>(S) A warning peculiar to VMS.  Perl keeps track of the number
of times you've called <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/fork.html">fork</a></code> and <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/exec.html">exec</a></code>, to determine
whether the current call to <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/exec.html">exec</a></code> should affect the current
script or a subprocess (see <a href="perlvms.html#exec-LIST">exec LIST in perlvms</a>).  Somehow, this count
has become scrambled, so Perl is making a guess and treating
this <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/exec.html">exec</a></code> as a request to terminate the Perl script
and execute the specified command.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="internal-disaster-in-regexp"></a><strong>internal disaster in regexp</strong>
<p>(P) Something went badly wrong in the regular expression parser.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="internal-urp-in-regexp-at-%2f%25s%2f"></a><strong>internal urp in regexp at /%s/</strong>
<p>(P) Something went badly awry in the regular expression parser.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Invalid-%25s-attribute%3a-%25s"></a><strong>Invalid %s attribute: %s</strong>
<p>The indicated attribute for a subroutine or variable was not recognized
by Perl or by a user-supplied handler.  See <a href="https://search.cpan.org/perldoc/attributes">attributes</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Invalid-%25s-attributes%3a-%25s"></a><strong>Invalid %s attributes: %s</strong>
<p>The indicated attributes for a subroutine or variable were not recognized
by Perl or by a user-supplied handler.  See <a href="https://search.cpan.org/perldoc/attributes">attributes</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="invalid-%5b%5d-range-%22%25s%22-in-regexp"></a><strong>invalid [] range "%s" in regexp</strong>
<p>(F) The range specified in a character class had a minimum character
greater than the maximum character.  See <a href="perlre.html">perlre</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Invalid-conversion-in-%25s%3a-%22%25s%22"></a><strong>Invalid conversion in %s: "%s"</strong>
<p>(W printf) Perl does not understand the given format conversion.
See <a class='function-name' href="functions/sprintf.html">sprintf</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Invalid-separator-character-%25s-in-attribute-list"></a><strong>Invalid separator character %s in attribute list</strong>
<p>(F) Something other than a colon or whitespace was seen between the
elements of an attribute list.  If the previous attribute
had a parenthesised parameter list, perhaps that list was terminated
too soon.  See <a href="https://search.cpan.org/perldoc/attributes">attributes</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Invalid-type-in-pack%3a-'%25s'"></a><strong>Invalid type in pack: '%s'</strong>
<p>(F) The given character is not a valid pack type.  See <a class='function-name' href="functions/pack.html">pack</a>.
(W pack) The given character is not a valid pack type but used to be silently
ignored.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Invalid-type-in-unpack%3a-'%25s'"></a><strong>Invalid type in unpack: '%s'</strong>
<p>(F) The given character is not a valid unpack type.  See <a class='function-name' href="functions/unpack.html">unpack</a>.
(W unpack) The given character is not a valid unpack type but used to be silently
ignored.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="ioctl-is-not-implemented"></a><strong>ioctl is not implemented</strong>
<p>(F) Your machine apparently doesn't implement ioctl(), which is pretty
strange for a machine that supports C.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="junk-on-end-of-regexp"></a><strong>junk on end of regexp</strong>
<p>(P) The regular expression parser is confused.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Label-not-found-for-%22last-%25s%22"></a><strong>Label not found for "last %s"</strong>
<p>(F) You named a loop to break out of, but you're not currently in a
loop of that name, not even if you count where you were called from.
See <a class='function-name' href="functions/last.html">last</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Label-not-found-for-%22next-%25s%22"></a><strong>Label not found for "next %s"</strong>
<p>(F) You named a loop to continue, but you're not currently in a loop of
that name, not even if you count where you were called from.  See
<a class='function-name' href="functions/last.html">last</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Label-not-found-for-%22redo-%25s%22"></a><strong>Label not found for "redo %s"</strong>
<p>(F) You named a loop to restart, but you're not currently in a loop of
that name, not even if you count where you were called from.  See
<a class='function-name' href="functions/last.html">last</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="leaving-effective-%25s-failed"></a><strong>leaving effective %s failed</strong>
<p>(F) While under the <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/use.html">use</a> <span class="w">filetest</span></code>
 pragma, switching the real and
effective uids or gids failed.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="listen()-on-closed-socket-%25s"></a><strong>listen() on closed socket %s</strong>
<p>(W closed) You tried to do a listen on a closed socket.  Did you forget to check
the return value of your socket() call?  See <a class='function-name' href="functions/listen.html">listen</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Lvalue-subs-returning-%25s-not-implemented-yet"></a><strong>Lvalue subs returning %s not implemented yet</strong>
<p>(F) Due to limitations in the current implementation, array and hash
values cannot be returned in subroutines used in lvalue context.
See <a href="perlsub.html#Lvalue-subroutines">Lvalue subroutines in perlsub</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Method-for-operation-%25s-not-found-in-package-%25s-during-blessing"></a><strong>Method for operation %s not found in package %s during blessing</strong>
<p>(F) An attempt was made to specify an entry in an overloading table that
doesn't resolve to a valid subroutine.  See <a href="https://search.cpan.org/perldoc/overload">overload</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Method-%25s-not-permitted"></a><strong>Method %s not permitted</strong>
<p>See Server error.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Might-be-a-runaway-multi-line-%25s-string-starting-on-line-%25d"></a><strong>Might be a runaway multi-line %s string starting on line %d</strong>
<p>(S) An advisory indicating that the previous error may have been caused
by a missing delimiter on a string or pattern, because it eventually
ended earlier on the current line.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Misplaced-_-in-number"></a><strong>Misplaced _ in number</strong>
<p>(W syntax) An underline in a decimal constant wasn't on a 3-digit boundary.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Missing-%24-on-loop-variable"></a><strong>Missing $ on loop variable</strong>
<p>(F) Apparently you've been programming in <strong>csh</strong> too much.  Variables are always
mentioned with the $ in Perl, unlike in the shells, where it can vary from
one line to the next.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Missing-%25sbrace%25s-on-%5cN%7b%7d"></a><strong>Missing %sbrace%s on \N{}</strong>
<p>(F) Wrong syntax of character name literal <code class="inline">\<span class="i">N</span><span class="s">{</span><span class="w">charname</span><span class="s">}</span></code>
 within
double-quotish context.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Missing-comma-after-first-argument-to-%25s-function"></a><strong>Missing comma after first argument to %s function</strong>
<p>(F) While certain functions allow you to specify a filehandle or an
"indirect object" before the argument list, this ain't one of them.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Missing-command-in-piped-open"></a><strong>Missing command in piped open</strong>
<p>(W pipe) You used the <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/open.html">open</a><span class="s">(</span><span class="w">FH</span><span class="cm">,</span> <span class="q">&quot;| command&quot;</span><span class="s">)</span></code>
 or <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/open.html">open</a><span class="s">(</span><span class="w">FH</span><span class="cm">,</span> <span class="q">&quot;command |&quot;</span><span class="s">)</span></code>

construction, but the command was missing or blank.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="(Missing-operator-before-%25s%3f)"></a><strong>(Missing operator before %s?)</strong>
<p>(S) This is an educated guess made in conjunction with the message "%s
found where operator expected".  Often the missing operator is a comma.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Missing-right-curly-or-square-bracket"></a><strong>Missing right curly or square bracket</strong>
<p>(F) The lexer counted more opening curly or square brackets than
closing ones.  As a general rule, you'll find it's missing near the place
you were last editing.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Modification-of-a-read-only-value-attempted"></a><strong>Modification of a read-only value attempted</strong>
<p>(F) You tried, directly or indirectly, to change the value of a
constant.  You didn't, of course, try "2 = 1", because the compiler
catches that.  But an easy way to do the same thing is:</p>
<pre class="verbatim"><ol><li><a name="mod"></a>    sub <span class="m">mod</span> <span class="s">{</span> <span class="i">$_</span>[<span class="n">0</span>] = <span class="n">1</span> <span class="s">}</span></li><li>    <span class="i">mod</span><span class="s">(</span><span class="n">2</span><span class="s">)</span><span class="sc">;</span></li></ol></pre><p>Another way is to assign to a substr() that's off the end of the string.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Modification-of-non-creatable-array-value-attempted%2c-subscript-%25d"></a><strong>Modification of non-creatable array value attempted, subscript %d</strong>
<p>(F) You tried to make an array value spring into existence, and the
subscript was probably negative, even counting from end of the array
backwards.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Modification-of-non-creatable-hash-value-attempted%2c-subscript-%22%25s%22"></a><strong>Modification of non-creatable hash value attempted, subscript "%s"</strong>
<p>(P) You tried to make a hash value spring into existence, and it couldn't
be created for some peculiar reason.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Module-name-must-be-constant"></a><strong>Module name must be constant</strong>
<p>(F) Only a bare module name is allowed as the first argument to a "use".</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="msg%25s-not-implemented"></a><strong>msg%s not implemented</strong>
<p>(F) You don't have System V message IPC on your system.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Multidimensional-syntax-%25s-not-supported"></a><strong>Multidimensional syntax %s not supported</strong>
<p>(W syntax) Multidimensional arrays aren't written like <code class="inline"><span class="i">$foo</span>[<span class="n">1</span><span class="cm">,</span><span class="n">2</span><span class="cm">,</span><span class="n">3</span>]</code>
.  They're written
like <code class="inline"><span class="i">$foo</span>[<span class="n">1</span>][<span class="n">2</span>][<span class="n">3</span>]</code>
, as in C.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Missing-name-in-%22my-sub%22"></a><strong>Missing name in "my sub"</strong>
<p>(F) The reserved syntax for lexically scoped subroutines requires that they
have a name with which they can be found.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Name-%22%25s%3a%3a%25s%22-used-only-once%3a-possible-typo"></a><strong>Name "%s::%s" used only once: possible typo</strong>
<p>(W once) Typographical errors often show up as unique variable names.
If you had a good reason for having a unique name, then just mention
it again somehow to suppress the message.  The <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/our.html">our</a></code> declaration is
provided for this purpose.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Negative-length"></a><strong>Negative length</strong>
<p>(F) You tried to do a read/write/send/recv operation with a buffer length
that is less than 0.  This is difficult to imagine.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="nested-*%3f%2b-in-regexp"></a><strong>nested *?+ in regexp</strong>
<p>(F) You can't quantify a quantifier without intervening parentheses.  So
things like ** or +* or ?* are illegal.</p>
<p>Note, however, that the minimal matching quantifiers, <code class="inline"><span class="i">*?</span></code>
, <code class="inline">+<span class="q">?</span></code>
, and <code class="inline"><span class="q">??</span></code>
 appear
to be nested quantifiers, but aren't.  See <a href="perlre.html">perlre</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="No-%23!-line"></a><strong>No #! line</strong>
<p>(F) The setuid emulator requires that scripts have a well-formed #! line
even on machines that don't support the #! construct.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="No-%25s-allowed-while-running-setuid"></a><strong>No %s allowed while running setuid</strong>
<p>(F) Certain operations are deemed to be too insecure for a setuid or setgid
script to even be allowed to attempt.  Generally speaking there will be
another way to do what you want that is, if not secure, at least securable.
See <a href="perlsec.html">perlsec</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="No-*-e*-allowed-in-setuid-scripts"></a><strong>No <strong>-e</strong> allowed in setuid scripts</strong>
<p>(F) A setuid script can't be specified by the user.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="No-%25s-specified-for--%25c"></a><strong>No %s specified for -%c</strong>
<p>(F) The indicated command line switch needs a mandatory argument, but
you haven't specified one.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="No-comma-allowed-after-%25s"></a><strong>No comma allowed after %s</strong>
<p>(F) A list operator that has a filehandle or "indirect object" is not
allowed to have a comma between that and the following arguments.
Otherwise it'd be just another one of the arguments.</p>
<p>One possible cause for this is that you expected to have imported a
constant to your name space with <strong>use</strong> or <strong>import</strong> while no such
importing took place, it may for example be that your operating system
does not support that particular constant. Hopefully you did use an
explicit import list for the constants you expect to see, please see
<a class='function-name' href="functions/use.html">use</a> and <a class='function-name' href="functions/import.html">import</a>. While an explicit import list
would probably have caught this error earlier it naturally does not
remedy the fact that your operating system still does not support that
constant. Maybe you have a typo in the constants of the symbol import
list of <strong>use</strong> or <strong>import</strong> or in the constant name at the line where
this error was triggered?</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="No-command-into-which-to-pipe-on-command-line"></a><strong>No command into which to pipe on command line</strong>
<p>(F) An error peculiar to VMS.  Perl handles its own command line redirection,
and found a '|' at the end of the command line, so it doesn't know where you
want to pipe the output from this command.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="No-DB%3a%3aDB-routine-defined"></a><strong>No DB::DB routine defined</strong>
<p>(F) The currently executing code was compiled with the <strong>-d</strong> switch,
but for some reason the perl5db.pl file (or some facsimile thereof)
didn't define a routine to be called at the beginning of each
statement.  Which is odd, because the file should have been required
automatically, and should have blown up the require if it didn't parse
right.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="No-dbm-on-this-machine"></a><strong>No dbm on this machine</strong>
<p>(P) This is counted as an internal error, because every machine should
supply dbm nowadays, because Perl comes with SDBM.  See <a href="https://search.cpan.org/perldoc/SDBM_File">SDBM_File</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="No-DBsub-routine"></a><strong>No DBsub routine</strong>
<p>(F) The currently executing code was compiled with the <strong>-d</strong> switch,
but for some reason the perl5db.pl file (or some facsimile thereof)
didn't define a DB::sub routine to be called at the beginning of each
ordinary subroutine call.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="No-error-file-after-2%3e-or-2%3e%3e-on-command-line"></a><strong>No error file after 2&gt; or 2&gt;&gt; on command line</strong>
<p>(F) An error peculiar to VMS.  Perl handles its own command line redirection,
and found a '2&gt;' or a '2&gt;&gt;' on the command line, but can't find
the name of the file to which to write data destined for stderr.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="No-input-file-after-%3c-on-command-line"></a><strong>No input file after &lt; on command line</strong>
<p>(F) An error peculiar to VMS.  Perl handles its own command line redirection,
and found a '&lt;' on the command line, but can't find the name of the file
from which to read data for stdin.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="No-output-file-after-%3e-on-command-line"></a><strong>No output file after &gt; on command line</strong>
<p>(F) An error peculiar to VMS.  Perl handles its own command line redirection,
and found a lone '&gt;' at the end of the command line, so it doesn't know
where you wanted to redirect stdout.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="No-output-file-after-%3e-or%3e%3e-on-command-line"></a><strong>No output file after &gt; or&gt;&gt; on command line</strong>
<p>(F) An error peculiar to VMS.  Perl handles its own command line redirection,
and found a '&gt;' or a '&gt;&gt;' on the command line, but can't find the
name of the file to which to write data destined for stdout.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="No-package-name-allowed-for-variable-%25s-in-%22our%22"></a><strong>No package name allowed for variable %s in "our"</strong>
<p>(F) Fully qualified variable names are not allowed in "our" declarations,
because that doesn't make much sense under existing semantics.  Such
syntax is reserved for future extensions.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="No-Perl-script-found-in-input"></a><strong>No Perl script found in input</strong>
<p>(F) You called <code class="inline"><span class="w">perl</span> -x</code>
, but no line was found in the file beginning
with #! and containing the word "perl".</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="No-setregid-available"></a><strong>No setregid available</strong>
<p>(F) Configure didn't find anything resembling the setregid() call for
your system.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="No-setreuid-available"></a><strong>No setreuid available</strong>
<p>(F) Configure didn't find anything resembling the setreuid() call for
your system.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="No-space-allowed-after--%25c"></a><strong>No space allowed after -%c</strong>
<p>(F) The argument to the indicated command line switch must follow immediately
after the switch, without intervening spaces.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="No-such-pseudo-hash-field-%22%25s%22"></a><strong>No such pseudo-hash field "%s"</strong>
<p>(F) You tried to access an array as a hash, but the field name used is
not defined.  The hash at index 0 should map all valid field names to
array indices for that to work.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="No-such-pseudo-hash-field-%22%25s%22-in-variable-%25s-of-type-%25s"></a><strong>No such pseudo-hash field "%s" in variable %s of type %s</strong>
<p>(F) You tried to access a field of a typed variable where the type
does not know about the field name.  The field names are looked up in
the %FIELDS hash in the type package at compile time.  The %FIELDS hash
is usually set up with the 'fields' pragma.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="No-such-pipe-open"></a><strong>No such pipe open</strong>
<p>(P) An error peculiar to VMS.  The internal routine my_pclose() tried to
close a pipe which hadn't been opened.  This should have been caught earlier as
an attempt to close an unopened filehandle.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="No-such-signal%3a-SIG%25s"></a><strong>No such signal: SIG%s</strong>
<p>(W signal) You specified a signal name as a subscript to %SIG that was not recognized.
Say <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/kill.html">kill</a> -l</code>
 in your shell to see the valid signal names on your system.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="no-UTC-offset-information%3b-assuming-local-time-is-UTC"></a><strong>no UTC offset information; assuming local time is UTC</strong>
<p>(S) A warning peculiar to VMS.  Perl was unable to find the local
timezone offset, so it's assuming that local system time is equivalent
to UTC.  If it's not, define the logical name <i>SYS$TIMEZONE_DIFFERENTIAL</i>
to translate to the number of seconds which need to be added to UTC to
get local time.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Not-a-CODE-reference"></a><strong>Not a CODE reference</strong>
<p>(F) Perl was trying to evaluate a reference to a code value (that is, a
subroutine), but found a reference to something else instead.  You can
use the ref() function to find out what kind of ref it really was.
See also <a href="perlref.html">perlref</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Not-a-format-reference"></a><strong>Not a format reference</strong>
<p>(F) I'm not sure how you managed to generate a reference to an anonymous
format, but this indicates you did, and that it didn't exist.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Not-a-GLOB-reference"></a><strong>Not a GLOB reference</strong>
<p>(F) Perl was trying to evaluate a reference to a "typeglob" (that is,
a symbol table entry that looks like <code class="inline"><span class="i">*foo</span></code>
), but found a reference to
something else instead.  You can use the ref() function to find out
what kind of ref it really was.  See <a href="perlref.html">perlref</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Not-a-HASH-reference"></a><strong>Not a HASH reference</strong>
<p>(F) Perl was trying to evaluate a reference to a hash value, but
found a reference to something else instead.  You can use the ref()
function to find out what kind of ref it really was.  See <a href="perlref.html">perlref</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Not-a-perl-script"></a><strong>Not a perl script</strong>
<p>(F) The setuid emulator requires that scripts have a well-formed #! line
even on machines that don't support the #! construct.  The line must
mention perl.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Not-a-SCALAR-reference"></a><strong>Not a SCALAR reference</strong>
<p>(F) Perl was trying to evaluate a reference to a scalar value, but
found a reference to something else instead.  You can use the ref()
function to find out what kind of ref it really was.  See <a href="perlref.html">perlref</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Not-a-subroutine-reference"></a><strong>Not a subroutine reference</strong>
<p>(F) Perl was trying to evaluate a reference to a code value (that is, a
subroutine), but found a reference to something else instead.  You can
use the ref() function to find out what kind of ref it really was.
See also <a href="perlref.html">perlref</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Not-a-subroutine-reference-in-overload-table"></a><strong>Not a subroutine reference in overload table</strong>
<p>(F) An attempt was made to specify an entry in an overloading table that
doesn't somehow point to a valid subroutine.  See <a href="https://search.cpan.org/perldoc/overload">overload</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Not-an-ARRAY-reference"></a><strong>Not an ARRAY reference</strong>
<p>(F) Perl was trying to evaluate a reference to an array value, but
found a reference to something else instead.  You can use the ref()
function to find out what kind of ref it really was.  See <a href="perlref.html">perlref</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Not-enough-arguments-for-%25s"></a><strong>Not enough arguments for %s</strong>
<p>(F) The function requires more arguments than you specified.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Not-enough-format-arguments"></a><strong>Not enough format arguments</strong>
<p>(W syntax) A format specified more picture fields than the next line supplied.
See <a href="perlform.html">perlform</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Null-filename-used"></a><strong>Null filename used</strong>
<p>(F) You can't require the null filename, especially because on many machines
that means the current directory!  See <a class='function-name' href="functions/require.html">require</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Null-picture-in-formline"></a><strong>Null picture in formline</strong>
<p>(F) The first argument to formline must be a valid format picture
specification.  It was found to be empty, which probably means you
supplied it an uninitialized value.  See <a href="perlform.html">perlform</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="NULL-OP-IN-RUN"></a><strong>NULL OP IN RUN</strong>
<p>(P debugging) Some internal routine called run() with a null opcode pointer.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Null-realloc"></a><strong>Null realloc</strong>
<p>(P) An attempt was made to realloc NULL.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="NULL-regexp-argument"></a><strong>NULL regexp argument</strong>
<p>(P) The internal pattern matching routines blew it big time.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="NULL-regexp-parameter"></a><strong>NULL regexp parameter</strong>
<p>(P) The internal pattern matching routines are out of their gourd.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Number-too-long"></a><strong>Number too long</strong>
<p>(F) Perl limits the representation of decimal numbers in programs to about
about 250 characters.  You've exceeded that length.  Future versions of
Perl are likely to eliminate this arbitrary limitation.  In the meantime,
try using scientific notation (e.g. "1e6" instead of "1_000_000").</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Octal-number-%3e-037777777777-non-portable"></a><strong>Octal number &gt; 037777777777 non-portable</strong>
<p>(W portable) The octal number you specified is larger than 2**32-1 (4294967295)
and therefore non-portable between systems.  See <a href="perlport.html">perlport</a> for more
on portability concerns.</p>
<p>See also <a href="perlport.html">perlport</a> for writing portable code.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Octal-number-in-vector-unsupported"></a><strong>Octal number in vector unsupported</strong>
<p>(F) Numbers with a leading <code class="inline"><span class="n">0</span></code>
 are not currently allowed in vectors.  The
octal number interpretation of such numbers may be supported in a future
version.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Odd-number-of-elements-in-hash-assignment"></a><strong>Odd number of elements in hash assignment</strong>
<p>(W misc) You specified an odd number of elements to initialize a hash, which
is odd, because hashes come in key/value pairs.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Offset-outside-string"></a><strong>Offset outside string</strong>
<p>(F) You tried to do a read/write/send/recv operation with an offset
pointing outside the buffer.  This is difficult to imagine.
The sole exception to this is that <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/sysread.html">sysread()</a></code>ing past the buffer
will extend the buffer and zero pad the new area.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="oops%3a-oopsAV"></a><strong>oops: oopsAV</strong>
<p>(S internal) An internal warning that the grammar is screwed up.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="oops%3a-oopsHV"></a><strong>oops: oopsHV</strong>
<p>(S internal) An internal warning that the grammar is screwed up.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Operation-%60%25s'%3a-no-method-found%2c-%25s"></a><strong>Operation `%s': no method found, %s</strong>
<p>(F) An attempt was made to perform an overloaded operation for which
no handler was defined.  While some handlers can be autogenerated in
terms of other handlers, there is no default handler for any
operation, unless <code class="inline"><span class="w">fallback</span></code>
 overloading key is specified to be
true.  See <a href="https://search.cpan.org/perldoc/overload">overload</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Operator-or-semicolon-missing-before-%25s"></a><strong>Operator or semicolon missing before %s</strong>
<p>(S ambiguous) You used a variable or subroutine call where the parser was
expecting an operator.  The parser has assumed you really meant
to use an operator, but this is highly likely to be incorrect.
For example, if you say "*foo *foo" it will be interpreted as
if you said "*foo * 'foo'".</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Out-of-memory!"></a><strong>Out of memory!</strong>
<p>(X) The malloc() function returned 0, indicating there was insufficient
remaining memory (or virtual memory) to satisfy the request.  Perl
has no option but to exit immediately.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Out-of-memory-for-yacc-stack"></a><strong>Out of memory for yacc stack</strong>
<p>(F) The yacc parser wanted to grow its stack so it could continue parsing,
but realloc() wouldn't give it more memory, virtual or otherwise.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Out-of-memory-during-request-for-%25s"></a><strong>Out of memory during request for %s</strong>
<p>(X|F) The malloc() function returned 0, indicating there was insufficient
remaining memory (or virtual memory) to satisfy the request.</p>
<p>The request was judged to be small, so the possibility to trap it
depends on the way perl was compiled.  By default it is not trappable.
However, if compiled for this, Perl may use the contents of <code class="inline"><span class="i">$^M</span></code>
 as
an emergency pool after die()ing with this message.  In this case the
error is trappable <i>once</i>.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Out-of-memory-during-%22large%22-request-for-%25s"></a><strong>Out of memory during "large" request for %s</strong>
<p>(F) The malloc() function returned 0, indicating there was insufficient
remaining memory (or virtual memory) to satisfy the request. However,
the request was judged large enough (compile-time default is 64K), so
a possibility to shut down by trapping this error is granted.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Out-of-memory-during-ridiculously-large-request"></a><strong>Out of memory during ridiculously large request</strong>
<p>(F) You can't allocate more than 2^31+"small amount" bytes.  This error
is most likely to be caused by a typo in the Perl program. e.g., <code class="inline"><span class="i">$arr</span>[<a class="l_k" href="functions/time.html">time</a>]</code>

instead of <code class="inline"><span class="i">$arr</span>[<span class="i">$time</span>]</code>
.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="page-overflow"></a><strong>page overflow</strong>
<p>(W io) A single call to write() produced more lines than can fit on a page.

<p>(F) The module in question uses features of a version of Perl more recent
than the currently running version.  How long has it been since you upgraded,
anyway?  See <a class='function-name' href="functions/require.html">require</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Permission-denied"></a><strong>Permission denied</strong>
<p>(F) The setuid emulator in suidperl decided you were up to no good.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="pid-%25x-not-a-child"></a><strong>pid %x not a child</strong>
<p>(W exec) A warning peculiar to VMS.  Waitpid() was asked to wait for a process which
isn't a subprocess of the current process.  While this is fine from VMS'
perspective, it's probably not what you intended.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="POSIX-getpgrp-can't-take-an-argument"></a><strong>POSIX getpgrp can't take an argument</strong>
<p>(F) Your system has POSIX getpgrp(), which takes no argument, unlike
the BSD version, which takes a pid.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Possible-Y2K-bug%3a-%25s"></a><strong>Possible Y2K bug: %s</strong>

</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Possible-attempt-to-put-comments-in-qw()-list"></a><strong>Possible attempt to put comments in qw() list</strong>
<p>(W qw) qw() lists contain items separated by whitespace; as with literal
strings, comment characters are not ignored, but are instead treated
as literal data.  (You may have used different delimiters than the
parentheses shown here; braces are also frequently used.)</p>
<p>You probably wrote something like this:</p>
<pre class="verbatim"><ol><li>    <span class="i">@list</span> = <span class="q">qw(</span></li><li>	<span class="q">a # a comment</span></li><li>        <span class="q">b # another comment</span></li><li>    <span class="q">)</span><span class="sc">;</span></li></ol></pre><p>when you should have written this:</p>

<li><a class='view-title' id="Possible-attempt-to-separate-words-with-commas"></a><strong>Possible attempt to separate words with commas</strong>
<p>(W qw) qw() lists contain items separated by whitespace; therefore commas
aren't needed to separate the items.  (You may have used different
delimiters than the parentheses shown here; braces are also frequently
used.)</p>
<p>You probably wrote something like this:</p>
<pre class="verbatim"><ol><li>    <span class="q">qw! a, b, c !</span><span class="sc">;</span></li></ol></pre><p>which puts literal commas into some of the list items.  Write it without

<li><a class='view-title' id="Possible-memory-corruption%3a-%25s-overflowed-3rd-argument"></a><strong>Possible memory corruption: %s overflowed 3rd argument</strong>
<p>(F) An ioctl() or fcntl() returned more than Perl was bargaining for.
Perl guesses a reasonable buffer size, but puts a sentinel byte at the

</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Range-iterator-outside-integer-range"></a><strong>Range iterator outside integer range</strong>
<p>(F) One (or both) of the numeric arguments to the range operator ".."
are outside the range which can be represented by integers internally.
One possible workaround is to force Perl to use magical string
increment by prepending "0" to your numbers.</p>

<li><a class='view-title' id="Reference-found-where-even-sized-list-expected"></a><strong>Reference found where even-sized list expected</strong>
<p>(W misc) You gave a single reference where Perl was expecting a list with
an even number of elements (for assignment to a hash). This
usually means that you used the anon hash constructor when you meant 
to use parens. In any case, a hash requires key/value <strong>pairs</strong>.</p>

<p>(F) You can't specify a repeat count so large that it overflows
your signed integers.  See <a class='function-name' href="functions/pack.html">pack</a>.</p>

</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Reversed-%25s%3d-operator"></a><strong>Reversed %s= operator</strong>
<p>(W syntax) You wrote your assignment operator backwards.  The = must always
comes last, to avoid ambiguity with subsequent unary operators.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Runaway-format"></a><strong>Runaway format</strong>
<p>(F) Your format contained the ~~ repeat-until-blank sequence, but it
produced 200 lines at once, and the 200th line looked exactly like the
199th line.  Apparently you didn't arrange for the arguments to exhaust
themselves, either by using ^ instead of @ (for scalar variables), or by
shifting or popping (for array variables).  See <a href="perlform.html">perlform</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Scalar-value-%40%25s%5b%25s%5d-better-written-as-%24%25s%5b%25s%5d"></a><strong>Scalar value @%s[%s] better written as $%s[%s]</strong>
<p>(W syntax) You've used an array slice (indicated by @) to select a single element of
an array.  Generally it's better to ask for a scalar value (indicated by $).
The difference is that <code class="inline"><span class="i">$foo</span>[<span class="i">&amp;bar</span>]</code>
 always behaves like a scalar, both when
assigning to it and when evaluating its argument, while <code class="inline"><span class="i">@foo</span>[<span class="i">&amp;bar</span>]</code>
 behaves
like a list when you assign to it, and provides a list context to its
subscript, which can do weird things if you're expecting only one subscript.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if you were actually hoping to treat the array
element as a list, you need to look into how references work, because
Perl will not magically convert between scalars and lists for you.  See
<a href="perlref.html">perlref</a>.</p>

<p>(F) Oddly, the suidperl program was invoked on a script without a setuid
or setgid bit set.  This doesn't make much sense.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Search-pattern-not-terminated"></a><strong>Search pattern not terminated</strong>
<p>(F) The lexer couldn't find the final delimiter of a // or m{}

Missing the leading <code class="inline"><span class="i">$</span></code>

<li><a class='view-title' id="Server-error"></a><strong>Server error</strong>
<p>This is the error message generally seen in a browser window when trying
to run a CGI program (including SSI) over the web. The actual error
text varies widely from server to server. The most frequently-seen
variants are "500 Server error", "Method (something) not permitted",
"Document contains no data", "Premature end of script headers", and
"Did not produce a valid header".</p>
<p><strong>This is a CGI error, not a Perl error</strong>.</p>
<p>You need to make sure your script is executable, is accessible by the user
CGI is running the script under (which is probably not the user account you
tested it under), does not rely on any environment variables (like PATH)
from the user it isn't running under, and isn't in a location where the CGI
server can't find it, basically, more or less.  Please see the following

<p>(F) Your system has the setpgrp() from BSD 4.2, which takes no arguments,

<p>(F) The setuid emulator won't run a script that is writable by the world,
because the world might have written on it already.</p>

<li><a class='view-title' id="Sort-subroutine-didn't-return-a-numeric-value"></a><strong>Sort subroutine didn't return a numeric value</strong>
<p>(F) A sort comparison routine must return a number.  You probably blew
it by not using <code class="inline">&lt;=&gt;</code>

on a filehandle that was either never opened or has since been closed.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Statement-unlikely-to-be-reached"></a><strong>Statement unlikely to be reached</strong>
<p>(W exec) You did an exec() with some statement after it other than a die().
This is almost always an error, because exec() never returns unless
there was a failure.  You probably wanted to use system() instead,
which does return.  To suppress this warning, put the exec() in a block
by itself.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Strange-*%2b%3f%7b%7d-on-zero-length-expression"></a><strong>Strange *+?{} on zero-length expression</strong>
<p>(W regexp) You applied a regular expression quantifier in a place where it
makes no sense, such as on a zero-width assertion.
Try putting the quantifier inside the assertion instead.  For example,
the way to match "abc" provided that it is followed by three
repetitions of "xyz" is <code class="inline"><span class="q">/abc(?=(?:xyz){3})/</span></code>
, not <code class="inline"><span class="q">/abc(?=xyz){3}/</span></code>

Stubs should never be implicitely created, but explicit calls to <code class="inline"><span class="w">can</span></code>

may break this.</p>

 may cause this error.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="substr-outside-of-string"></a><strong>substr outside of string</strong>
<p>(W substr),(F) You tried to reference a substr() that pointed outside of a
string.  That is, the absolute value of the offset was larger than the
length of the string.  See <a class='function-name' href="functions/substr.html">substr</a>.  This warning is
fatal if substr is used in an lvalue context (as the left hand side
of an assignment or as a subroutine argument for example).</p>
</li>

error giving more information.  (Sometimes it helps to turn on <strong>-w</strong>.)
The error message itself often tells you where it was in the line when
it decided to give up.  Sometimes the actual error is several tokens
before this, because Perl is good at understanding random input.
Occasionally the line number may be misleading, and once in a blue moon
the only way to figure out what's triggering the error is to call
<code class="inline"><span class="w">perl</span> -c</code>
 repeatedly, chopping away half the program each time to see
if the error went away.  Sort of the cybernetic version of 20 questions.</p>

<li><a class='view-title' id="syntax-error-at-line-%25d%3a-%60%25s'-unexpected"></a><strong>syntax error at line %d: `%s' unexpected</strong>
<p>(A) You've accidentally run your script through the Bourne shell
instead of Perl.  Check the #! line, or manually feed your script
into Perl yourself.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="System-V-%25s-is-not-implemented-on-this-machine"></a><strong>System V %s is not implemented on this machine</strong>
<p>(F) You tried to do something with a function beginning with "sem",
"shm", or "msg" but that System V IPC is not implemented in your
machine.  In some machines the functionality can exist but be
unconfigured.  Consult your system support.</p>

<p>(W closed) The filehandle you're writing to got itself closed sometime before now.
Check your logic flow.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Target-of-goto-is-too-deeply-nested"></a><strong>Target of goto is too deeply nested</strong>
<p>(F) You tried to use <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/goto.html">goto</a></code> to reach a label that was too deeply
nested for Perl to reach.  Perl is doing you a favor by refusing.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="tell()-on-unopened-file"></a><strong>tell() on unopened file</strong>
<p>(W unopened) You tried to use the tell() function on a filehandle that was either
never opened or has since been closed.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Test-on-unopened-file-%3c%25s%3e"></a><strong>Test on unopened file &lt;%s&gt;</strong>

<li><a class='view-title' id="The-%25s-function-is-unimplemented"></a><strong>The %s function is unimplemented</strong>
<p>The function indicated isn't implemented on this architecture, according
to the probings of Configure.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="The-crypt()-function-is-unimplemented-due-to-excessive-paranoia"></a><strong>The crypt() function is unimplemented due to excessive paranoia</strong>
<p>(F) Configure couldn't find the crypt() function on your machine,
probably because your vendor didn't supply it, probably because they
think the U.S. Government thinks it's a secret, or at least that they
will continue to pretend that it is.  And if you quote me on that, I
will deny it.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="The-stat-preceding--l-_-wasn't-an-lstat"></a><strong>The stat preceding <code class="inline">-l <span class="i">_</span></code>
 wasn't an lstat</strong>
<p>(F) It makes no sense to test the current stat buffer for symbolic linkhood
if the last stat that wrote to the stat buffer already went past
the symlink to get to the real file.  Use an actual filename instead.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="This-Perl-can't-reset-CRTL-environ-elements-(%25s)"></a><strong>This Perl can't reset CRTL environ elements (%s)</strong>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="This-Perl-can't-set-CRTL-environ-elements-(%25s%3d%25s)"></a><strong>This Perl can't set CRTL environ elements (%s=%s)</strong>
<p>(W internal) Warnings peculiar to VMS.  You tried to change or delete an element
of the CRTL's internal environ array, but your copy of Perl wasn't
built with a CRTL that contained the setenv() function.  You'll need to
rebuild Perl with a CRTL that does, or redefine <i>PERL_ENV_TABLES</i> (see
<a href="perlvms.html">perlvms</a>) so that the environ array isn't the target of the change to
%ENV which produced the warning.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="times-not-implemented"></a><strong>times not implemented</strong>
<p>(F) Your version of the C library apparently doesn't do times().  I suspect
you're not running on Unix.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Too-few-args-to-syscall"></a><strong>Too few args to syscall</strong>
<p>(F) There has to be at least one argument to syscall() to specify the
system call to call, silly dilly.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Too-late-for-%22*-T*%22-option"></a><strong>Too late for "<strong>-T</strong>" option</strong>
<p>(X) The #! line (or local equivalent) in a Perl script contains the
<strong>-T</strong> option, but Perl was not invoked with <strong>-T</strong> in its command line.
This is an error because, by the time Perl discovers a <strong>-T</strong> in a
script, it's too late to properly taint everything from the environment.
So Perl gives up.</p>
<p>If the Perl script is being executed as a command using the #!
mechanism (or its local equivalent), this error can usually be fixed
by editing the #! line so that the <strong>-T</strong> option is a part of Perl's
first argument: e.g. change <code class="inline"><span class="w">perl</span> -<span class="w">n</span> -T</code>
 to <code class="inline"><span class="w">perl</span> -T -<span class="w">n</span></code>
.</p>
<p>If the Perl script is being executed as <code class="inline"><span class="w">perl</span> <span class="w">scriptname</span></code>
, then the
<strong>-T</strong> option must appear on the command line: <code class="inline"><span class="w">perl</span> -T <span class="w">scriptname</span></code>
.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Too-late-for-%22-%25s%22-option"></a><strong>Too late for "-%s" option</strong>
<p>(X) The #! line (or local equivalent) in a Perl script contains the
<strong>-M</strong> or <strong>-m</strong> option.  This is an error because <strong>-M</strong> and <strong>-m</strong> options
are not intended for use inside scripts.  Use the <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/use.html">use</a></code> pragma instead.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Too-late-to-run-%25s-block"></a><strong>Too late to run %s block</strong>
<p>(W void) A CHECK or INIT block is being defined during run time proper,
when the opportunity to run them has already passed.  Perhaps you are
loading a file with <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/require.html">require</a></code> or <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/do.html">do</a></code> when you should be using
<code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/use.html">use</a></code> instead.  Or perhaps you should put the <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/require.html">require</a></code> or <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/do.html">do</a></code>
inside a BEGIN block.</p>

<li><a class='view-title' id="Too-many-('s"></a><strong>Too many ('s</strong>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Too-many-)'s"></a><strong>Too many )'s</strong>
<p>(A) You've accidentally run your script through <strong>csh</strong> instead
of Perl.  Check the #! line, or manually feed your script into
Perl yourself.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Too-many-args-to-syscall"></a><strong>Too many args to syscall</strong>
<p>(F) Perl supports a maximum of only 14 args to syscall().</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Too-many-arguments-for-%25s"></a><strong>Too many arguments for %s</strong>
<p>(F) The function requires fewer arguments than you specified.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="trailing-%5c-in-regexp"></a><strong>trailing \ in regexp</strong>
<p>(F) The regular expression ends with an unbackslashed backslash.  Backslash
it.   See <a href="perlre.html">perlre</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Transliteration-pattern-not-terminated"></a><strong>Transliteration pattern not terminated</strong>
<p>(F) The lexer couldn't find the interior delimiter of a tr/// or tr[][]

<li><a class='view-title' id="Transliteration-replacement-not-terminated"></a><strong>Transliteration replacement not terminated</strong>
<p>(F) The lexer couldn't find the final delimiter of a tr/// or tr[][]
construct.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="truncate-not-implemented"></a><strong>truncate not implemented</strong>
<p>(F) Your machine doesn't implement a file truncation mechanism that
Configure knows about.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Type-of-arg-%25d-to-%25s-must-be-%25s-(not-%25s)"></a><strong>Type of arg %d to %s must be %s (not %s)</strong>
<p>(F) This function requires the argument in that position to be of a
certain type.  Arrays must be @NAME or <code class="inline"><span class="i">@</span>{<span class="w">EXPR</span>}</code>
.  Hashes must be
%NAME or <code class="inline"><span class="i">%</span>{<span class="w">EXPR</span>}</code>
.  No implicit dereferencing is allowed--use the
{EXPR} forms as an explicit dereference.  See <a href="perlref.html">perlref</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="umask%3a-argument-is-missing-initial-0"></a><strong>umask: argument is missing initial 0</strong>
<p>(W umask) A umask of 222 is incorrect.  It should be 0222, because octal
literals always start with 0 in Perl, as in C.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="umask-not-implemented"></a><strong>umask not implemented</strong>
<p>(F) Your machine doesn't implement the umask function and you tried
to use it to restrict permissions for yourself (EXPR &amp; 0700).</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Unable-to-create-sub-named-%22%25s%22"></a><strong>Unable to create sub named "%s"</strong>
<p>(F) You attempted to create or access a subroutine with an illegal name.</p>

it's in a different package?  See <a class='function-name' href="functions/sort.html">sort</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Undefined-subroutine-%26%25s-called"></a><strong>Undefined subroutine &amp;%s called</strong>
<p>(F) The subroutine indicated hasn't been defined, or if it was, it
has since been undefined.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Undefined-subroutine-called"></a><strong>Undefined subroutine called</strong>
<p>(F) The anonymous subroutine you're trying to call hasn't been defined,
or if it was, it has since been undefined.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Undefined-subroutine-in-sort"></a><strong>Undefined subroutine in sort</strong>
<p>(F) The sort comparison routine specified is declared but doesn't seem to
have been defined yet.  See <a class='function-name' href="functions/sort.html">sort</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Undefined-top-format-%22%25s%22-called"></a><strong>Undefined top format "%s" called</strong>

another package?  See <a href="perlform.html">perlform</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Undefined-value-assigned-to-typeglob"></a><strong>Undefined value assigned to typeglob</strong>
<p>(W misc) An undefined value was assigned to a typeglob, a la <code class="inline"><span class="i">*foo</span> = <a class="l_k" href="functions/undef.html">undef</a></code>
.
This does nothing.  It's possible that you really mean <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/undef.html">undef</a> <span class="i">*foo</span></code>
.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="unexec-of-%25s-into-%25s-failed!"></a><strong>unexec of %s into %s failed!</strong>
<p>(F) The unexec() routine failed for some reason.  See your local FSF
representative, who probably put it there in the first place.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Unknown-BYTEORDER"></a><strong>Unknown BYTEORDER</strong>
<p>(F) There are no byte-swapping functions for a machine with this byte order.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Unknown-open()-mode-'%25s'"></a><strong>Unknown open() mode '%s'</strong>
<p>(F) The second argument of 3-argument open() is not among the list
of valid modes: <code class="inline">&lt;</code>
, <code class="inline">&gt;</code>
, <code class="inline">&gt;&gt;</code>
, <code class="inline">+&lt;</code>

<p>(P) An error peculiar to VMS.  Perl was reading values for %ENV before
iterating over it, and someone else stuck a message in the stream of
data Perl expected.  Someone's very confused, or perhaps trying to
subvert Perl's population of %ENV for nefarious purposes.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="unmatched-()-in-regexp"></a><strong>unmatched () in regexp</strong>
<p>(F) Unbackslashed parentheses must always be balanced in regular
expressions.  If you're a vi user, the % key is valuable for finding
the matching parenthesis.  See <a href="perlre.html">perlre</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Unmatched-right-%25s-bracket"></a><strong>Unmatched right %s bracket</strong>
<p>(F) The lexer counted more closing curly or square brackets than
opening ones, so you're probably missing a matching opening bracket.
As a general rule, you'll find the missing one (so to speak) near the
place you were last editing.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="unmatched-%5b%5d-in-regexp"></a><strong>unmatched [] in regexp</strong>
<p>(F) The brackets around a character class must match.  If you wish to
include a closing bracket in a character class, backslash it or put it first.
See <a href="perlre.html">perlre</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Unquoted-string-%22%25s%22-may-clash-with-future-reserved-word"></a><strong>Unquoted string "%s" may clash with future reserved word</strong>
<p>(W reserved) You used a bareword that might someday be claimed as a reserved word.
It's best to put such a word in quotes, or capitalize it somehow, or insert
an underbar into it.  You might also declare it as a subroutine.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Unrecognized-character-%25s"></a><strong>Unrecognized character %s</strong>
<p>(F) The Perl parser has no idea what to do with the specified character
in your Perl script (or eval).  Perhaps you tried to run a compressed
script, a binary program, or a directory as a Perl program.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Unrecognized-escape-%5c%5c%25c-passed-through"></a><strong>Unrecognized escape \\%c passed through</strong>
<p>(W misc) You used a backslash-character combination which is not recognized
by Perl.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Unrecognized-signal-name-%22%25s%22"></a><strong>Unrecognized signal name "%s"</strong>
<p>(F) You specified a signal name to the kill() function that was not recognized.
Say <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/kill.html">kill</a> -l</code>
 in your shell to see the valid signal names on your system.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Unrecognized-switch%3a--%25s--(-h-will-show-valid-options)"></a><strong>Unrecognized switch: -%s  (-h will show valid options)</strong>
<p>(F) You specified an illegal option to Perl.  Don't do that.
(If you think you didn't do that, check the #! line to see if it's
supplying the bad switch on your behalf.)</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Unsuccessful-%25s-on-filename-containing-newline"></a><strong>Unsuccessful %s on filename containing newline</strong>
<p>(W newline) A file operation was attempted on a filename, and that operation
failed, PROBABLY because the filename contained a newline, PROBABLY
because you forgot to chop() or chomp() it off.  See <a class='function-name' href="functions/chomp.html">chomp</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Unsupported-directory-function-%22%25s%22-called"></a><strong>Unsupported directory function "%s" called</strong>
<p>(F) Your machine doesn't support opendir() and readdir().</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Unsupported-function-fork"></a><strong>Unsupported function fork</strong>
<p>(F) Your version of executable does not support forking.</p>
<p>Note that under some systems, like OS/2, there may be different flavors of
Perl executables, some of which may support fork, some not. Try changing
the name you call Perl by to <code class="inline"><span class="w">perl_</span></code>
, <code class="inline"><span class="w">perl__</span></code>
, and so on.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Unsupported-function-%25s"></a><strong>Unsupported function %s</strong>
<p>(F) This machine doesn't implement the indicated function, apparently.
At least, Configure doesn't think so.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Unsupported-socket-function-%22%25s%22-called"></a><strong>Unsupported socket function "%s" called</strong>
<p>(F) Your machine doesn't support the Berkeley socket mechanism, or at
least that's what Configure thought.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Unterminated-%3c%3e-operator"></a><strong>Unterminated &lt;&gt; operator</strong>
<p>(F) The lexer saw a left angle bracket in a place where it was expecting
a term, so it's looking for the corresponding right angle bracket, and not
finding it.  Chances are you left some needed parentheses out earlier in
the line, and you really meant a "less than".</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Unterminated-attribute-parameter-in-attribute-list"></a><strong>Unterminated attribute parameter in attribute list</strong>
<p>(F) The lexer saw an opening (left) parenthesis character while parsing an
attribute list, but the matching closing (right) parenthesis
character was not found.  You may need to add (or remove) a backslash
character to get your parentheses to balance.  See <a href="https://search.cpan.org/perldoc/attributes">attributes</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Unterminated-attribute-list"></a><strong>Unterminated attribute list</strong>
<p>(F) The lexer found something other than a simple identifier at the start
of an attribute, and it wasn't a semicolon or the start of a
block.  Perhaps you terminated the parameter list of the previous attribute
too soon.  See <a href="https://search.cpan.org/perldoc/attributes">attributes</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Use-of-%24%23-is-deprecated"></a><strong>Use of $# is deprecated</strong>
<p>(D deprecated) This was an ill-advised attempt to emulate a poorly defined <strong>awk</strong> feature.
Use an explicit printf() or sprintf() instead.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Use-of-%24*-is-deprecated"></a><strong>Use of $* is deprecated</strong>
<p>(D deprecated) This variable magically turned on multi-line pattern matching, both for
you and for any luckless subroutine that you happen to call.  You should
use the new <code class="inline"><span class="q">//m</span></code>
 and <code class="inline"><span class="q">//s</span></code>
 modifiers now to do that without the dangerous
action-at-a-distance effects of <code class="inline"><span class="i">$*</span></code>
.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Use-of-%25s-in-printf-format-not-supported"></a><strong>Use of %s in printf format not supported</strong>
<p>(F) You attempted to use a feature of printf that is accessible from
only C.  This usually means there's a better way to do it in Perl.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Use-of-bare-%3c%3c-to-mean-%3c%3c%22%22-is-deprecated"></a><strong>Use of bare &lt;&lt; to mean &lt;&lt;"" is deprecated</strong>
<p>(D deprecated) You are now encouraged to use the explicitly quoted form if you
wish to use an empty line as the terminator of the here-document.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Use-of-implicit-split-to-%40_-is-deprecated"></a><strong>Use of implicit split to @_ is deprecated</strong>
<p>(D deprecated) It makes a lot of work for the compiler when you clobber a
subroutine's argument list, so it's better if you assign the results of
a split() explicitly to an array (or list).</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Use-of-inherited-AUTOLOAD-for-non-method-%25s()-is-deprecated"></a><strong>Use of inherited AUTOLOAD for non-method %s() is deprecated</strong>
<p>(D deprecated) As an (ahem) accidental feature, <code class="inline">AUTOLOAD</code>
 subroutines are
looked up as methods (using the <code class="inline"><span class="i">@ISA</span></code>
 hierarchy) even when the subroutines
to be autoloaded were called as plain functions (e.g.  <code class="inline"><span class="i">Foo::bar</span><span class="s">(</span><span class="s">)</span></code>
),
not as methods (e.g. <code class="inline"><span class="w">Foo</span><span class="w">-&gt;bar</span><span class="s">(</span><span class="s">)</span></code>
 or <code class="inline"><span class="i">$obj</span><span class="i">-&gt;bar</span><span class="s">(</span><span class="s">)</span></code>
).</p>
<p>This bug will be rectified in Perl 5.005, which will use method lookup
only for methods' <code class="inline">AUTOLOAD</code>
s.  However, there is a significant base
of existing code that may be using the old behavior.  So, as an
interim step, Perl 5.004 issues an optional warning when non-methods
use inherited <code class="inline">AUTOLOAD</code>
s.</p>
<p>The simple rule is:  Inheritance will not work when autoloading
non-methods.  The simple fix for old code is:  In any module that used to
depend on inheriting <code class="inline">AUTOLOAD</code>
 for non-methods from a base class named
<code class="inline"><span class="w">BaseClass</span></code>
, execute <code class="inline"><span class="i">*AUTOLOAD</span> = \<span class="i">&amp;BaseClass::AUTOLOAD</span></code>
 during startup.</p>
<p>In code that currently says <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/use.html">use</a> <span class="w">AutoLoader</span><span class="sc">;</span> <span class="i">@ISA</span> = <span class="q">qw(AutoLoader)</span><span class="sc">;</span></code>
 you
should remove AutoLoader from @ISA and change <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/use.html">use</a> <span class="w">AutoLoader</span><span class="sc">;</span></code>
 to
<code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/use.html">use</a> <span class="w">AutoLoader</span> <span class="q">&#39;AUTOLOAD&#39;</span><span class="sc">;</span></code>
.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Use-of-reserved-word-%22%25s%22-is-deprecated"></a><strong>Use of reserved word "%s" is deprecated</strong>
<p>(D deprecated) The indicated bareword is a reserved word.  Future versions of perl
may use it as a keyword, so you're better off either explicitly quoting
the word in a manner appropriate for its context of use, or using a
different name altogether.  The warning can be suppressed for subroutine
names by either adding a <code class="inline"><span class="i">&amp;</span></code>
 prefix, or using a package qualifier,
e.g. <code class="inline"><span class="i">&amp;our</span><span class="s">(</span><span class="s">)</span></code>
, or <code class="inline"><span class="i">Foo::our</span><span class="s">(</span><span class="s">)</span></code>

bad side effects.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Use-of-uninitialized-value%25s"></a><strong>Use of uninitialized value%s</strong>
<p>(W uninitialized) An undefined value was used as if it were already defined.  It was
interpreted as a "" or a 0, but maybe it was a mistake.  To suppress this
warning assign a defined value to your variables.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Useless-use-of-%22re%22-pragma"></a><strong>Useless use of "re" pragma</strong>
<p>(W) You did <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/use.html">use</a> <span class="w">re</span><span class="sc">;</span></code>
 without any arguments.   That isn't very useful.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Useless-use-of-%25s-in-void-context"></a><strong>Useless use of %s in void context</strong>
<p>(W void) You did something without a side effect in a context that does nothing
with the return value, such as a statement that doesn't return a value
from a block, or the left side of a scalar comma operator.  Very often
this points not to stupidity on your part, but a failure of Perl to parse
your program the way you thought it would.  For example, you'd get this
if you mixed up your C precedence with Python precedence and said</p>
<pre class="verbatim"><ol><li>    <span class="i">$one</span><span class="cm">,</span> <span class="i">$two</span> = <span class="n">1</span><span class="cm">,</span> <span class="n">2</span><span class="sc">;</span></li></ol></pre><p>when you meant to say</p>
<pre class="verbatim"><ol><li>    <span class="s">(</span><span class="i">$one</span><span class="cm">,</span> <span class="i">$two</span><span class="s">)</span> = <span class="s">(</span><span class="n">1</span><span class="cm">,</span> <span class="n">2</span><span class="s">)</span><span class="sc">;</span></li></ol></pre><p>Another common error is to use ordinary parentheses to construct a list
reference when you should be using square or curly brackets, for
example, if you say</p>
<pre class="verbatim"><ol><li>    <span class="i">$array</span> = <span class="s">(</span><span class="n">1</span><span class="cm">,</span><span class="n">2</span><span class="s">)</span><span class="sc">;</span></li></ol></pre><p>when you should have said</p>

while parentheses do not.  So when a parenthesized list is evaluated in
a scalar context, the comma is treated like C's comma operator, which
throws away the left argument, which is not what you want.  See
<a href="perlref.html">perlref</a> for more on this.</p>

<li><a class='view-title' id="Variable-%22%25s%22-is-not-imported%25s"></a><strong>Variable "%s" is not imported%s</strong>
<p>(F) While "use strict" in effect, you referred to a global variable
that you apparently thought was imported from another module, because
something else of the same name (usually a subroutine) is exported
by that module.  It usually means you put the wrong funny character
on the front of your variable.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Variable-%22%25s%22-may-be-unavailable"></a><strong>Variable "%s" may be unavailable</strong>
<p>(W closure) An inner (nested) <i>anonymous</i> subroutine is inside a <i>named</i>
subroutine, and outside that is another subroutine; and the anonymous
(innermost) subroutine is referencing a lexical variable defined in
the outermost subroutine.  For example:</p>
<pre class="verbatim"><ol><li><a name="outermost"></a><a name="middle"></a>   sub <span class="m">outermost</span> <span class="s">{</span> <a class="l_k" href="functions/my.html">my</a> <span class="i">$a</span><span class="sc">;</span> sub <span class="m">middle</span> <span class="s">{</span> <a class="l_k" href="functions/sub.html">sub</a> <span class="s">{</span> <span class="i">$a</span> <span class="s">}</span> <span class="s">}</span> <span class="s">}</span></li></ol></pre><p>If the anonymous subroutine is called or referenced (directly or
indirectly) from the outermost subroutine, it will share the variable
as you would expect.  But if the anonymous subroutine is called or
referenced when the outermost subroutine is not active, it will see
the value of the shared variable as it was before and during the
*first* call to the outermost subroutine, which is probably not what
you want.</p>
<p>In these circumstances, it is usually best to make the middle
subroutine anonymous, using the <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/sub.html">sub</a> <span class="s">{</span><span class="s">}</span></code>
 syntax.  Perl has specific
support for shared variables in nested anonymous subroutines; a named
subroutine in between interferes with this feature.</p>
</li>
<li><a class='view-title' id="Variable-%22%25s%22-will-not-stay-shared"></a><strong>Variable "%s" will not stay shared</strong>
<p>(W closure) An inner (nested) <i>named</i> subroutine is referencing a lexical
variable defined in an outer subroutine.</p>
<p>When the inner subroutine is called, it will probably see the value of
the outer subroutine's variable as it was before and during the
*first* call to the outer subroutine; in this case, after the first
call to the outer subroutine is complete, the inner and outer
subroutines will no longer share a common value for the variable.  In
other words, the variable will no longer be shared.</p>
<p>Furthermore, if the outer subroutine is anonymous and references a
lexical variable outside itself, then the outer and inner subroutines
will <i>never</i> share the given variable.</p>
<p>This problem can usually be solved by making the inner subroutine
anonymous, using the <code class="inline"><a class="l_k" href="functions/sub.html">sub</a> <span class="s">{</span><span class="s">}</span></code>
 syntax.  When inner anonymous subs that
reference variables in outer subroutines are called or referenced,
they are automatically rebound to the current values of such
variables.</p>

This error means that Perl detected that you and/or your system

not use those settings.  This was not dead serious, fortunately: there
is a "default locale" called "C" that Perl can and will use, the
script will be run.  Before you really fix the problem, however, you
will get the same error message each time you run Perl.  How to really

<p>(F) And you probably never will, because you probably don't have the

if there are more than 9 backreferences.</p>
